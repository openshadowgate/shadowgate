/adm
The mud's secure directory

Only mud administration, the top administration, should have access to
this directory.  People with access to this directory can screw up
the mud, since no matter what other access you gave them, they casn
get access to the whole mud just in virtue of having access to this dir.
Ideally, only objects in /adm/obj would have Root access.  Since this
security system is relatively new, however, /adm/daemon retains
Root access for the time being.  In truth, the only object on the mud
which needs Root access under this security system is the master object.
I left login.c with Root for the sake of simplicity, and simul_efun
object always acts as if it were root anyways.  

The directory is subdivided as follows:

/adm/daemon:
Secure daemons.  These do not need Root access, but they do need the sort
of access that can screw the mud up if misused.  For example, the banish
objects, if misused, could prevent admins from logging in.

/adm/db:
Secure databases.  These are databases no one but admins should have access to.
A good example here is the access.db which determines what access
different euid's have.

/adm/etc:
A special junk directory just for the arches.  You can store stuff in
there away from prying eyes.

/adm/include:
The mud include directory.  Again, access here means you can do things
like redefine euid Root and such.

/adm/obj:
Objects needing root access.

/adm/save:
A save directory for data which should not be readable by the general
populace.

/adm/simul_efun:
All the simul_efun code is stored here, modularly, so that adding and
removing simul_efuns is simple.
