This name is currently filtered from being used.

Typically a name is placed on this list when a non newbie character commits
suicide in order to make it easier to restore a character should someone
change their mind. This will expire after a period of time (usually two real 
life weeks for a suicide) to allow for names to be re-used.

If you want to reclaim this name sooner, your options are:

 * mail law@shadowgate.org
 * contact one of known admins

Sorry for the inconvinience.
