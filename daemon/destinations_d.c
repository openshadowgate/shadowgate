/* This daemon generates and stores 'waystation' information for named 'destinations'. The concept is that for each named 'destination', the daemon remembers a number of 'waystations', which are rooms radiating outwards from the destination, no more than 5 steps apart. For each 'waystation', the daemon also remembers how many 'stages' (sets of approximatly 5 steps) away from the final destination it is.

The waystations are used in conjunction with some new code in monster.c to allow mobs to find their way from where they are, to a named destination. Note that this only works if the mob starts from within 5 steps of a room which has a 'waystation' setting for the named destination.

To set up a room to be a destination, there are a number of options. You can manually work out all the rooms that you want to have waystations, and what stages they need to be at. (You will need to have mapped out the area in order to work this out). You can then manually add those waystation settings to your destination room in the room's create function:

#define DEST "/daemon/destinations_d.c"

void create(){
  ::create();
  ... BLAH...
  DEST->add_waystation(string <destination_room>, <destination_room>, 1);
  DEST->add_waystation(string <destination_room>, <room1>, 2);
  DEST->add_waystation(string <destination_room>, <room2>, 2);
  DEST->add_waystation(string <destination_room>, <room3>, 3);
  DEST->add_waystation(string <destination_room>, <room4>, 3);
  ... etc
}

OR, you can use the automatic waystation generator:

#define DEST "/daemon/destinations_d.c"

void create(){
  object * rooms;
  ::create();
  ... BLAH...
  DEST->generate_waystations(file_name(TO),2, 3);
  // this would generate 2 stages of waystations radiating from the 
  // current room.  Each waystation would be 3 stages further away than
  // the last. NOTE: the code to generate waystations can get
  // quite processor intensive and cause lag pockets if you set
  // the 'stages' or 'spacing' too high. It's recommended to manually
  // enter the stages as above, if spacing *stages would be higher than
  // about 15.
  // However, you can use the 'generate waystations' function as a one-off
  // and make a note of which rooms it sets waystations in, to save you
  // the bother of mapping it all out. The code is not perfect though, 
  // and will not necessarily set you the 'best' or shortest routes for
  // mobs to follow, so manually mapping it is still preferable.
  // Another possibility is to manually map in a few 'key' waystations
  // (eg along a main path that you want mobs to follow), and then
  // use the 'generate waystations' function to work out all the 
  // more fiddly 'fill in' waystation rooms.
