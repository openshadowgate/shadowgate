Quickly finding themselves in over their heads, the group attempted to escape by slipping past Judatac.  The Rear Guard, however, sensed their approach and quickly engaged the group of would-be heroes.  In a heroic act, Seldanna threw herself full-force at Judatac, effectively sacrificing herself to allow her companions to escape.  This was her weapon, forged by some of the finest bladesmiths in Ashatae'Rathnai.");
