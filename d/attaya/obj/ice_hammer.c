%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^This beautifully carved hammer looks to be made from solid %^RESET%^%^WHITE%^i%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^c%^RESET%^%^WHITE%^e%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^. The head of the hammer has a %^BOLD%^%^YELLOW%^gold %^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^reinforced pommel and has small indentions within it, maximizing force. The handle is wrapped in a thin layer of cloth, which seems to have melded within the weapon giving you a very steady grip. Despite being almost entirely made of ice, the hammer is not that cold to the touch.%^RESET%^

This was forged by the dwarf Teiral Stormhammer in the dwarven city of Kinaro almost 70 years ago. His personal weapon for many years, it won him many victories. About 30 years ago, however, the famed dwarf disappeared, as did his hammer, and was never heard from again.
