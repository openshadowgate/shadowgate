This is a small clay sphere. It has only a single small divot scarring its surface. You notice it is very heavy for such a small item; its density must be very high.
The small divot is about the size of a small finger tip. It is as smooth on its inside as the sphere is on the outside.

These ancient devices once protected war leaders in conference. They didn't trust their mages to hear their plans. They commanded that these devices were created to protect them from interuptions. They are short lived, but at one point could be recharged.
