%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Made of blackened steel, this metal blade is shaped to look like a long sword.  The %^WHITE%^bone%^BLACK%^ hilt of the blade has been carved into a twisting spiral shape, with a %^WHITE%^silver%^BLACK%^ jawless skull set into the bottom.  The blade of the sword is long and narrow, typical of long swords, though this one seems to carry a curious trait.  The edge of the blade has not been sharpened. In fact the design of the blade itself seems as if the creator intended for this sword to provide blunt damage, instead of the typical slashing.  A geometrical pattern of squares and circles has been etched into the steel blade.  A most curious weapon.

The Dark Sun's Blade was made by a maurader priest of Cyric's faith around the year 634.  The cleric, who's name has alread been forgotten, so wished to emulate his Dark Lord in combat.  Tired of the use of maces and flails to strike the message of Cyric into the hearts of others, he began to take up the art of weaponsmithing.  With his new found skills he began to fashion a sword that is a copy of the divine blade the Dark Sun is said to wield in battle.  The cleric though did not seem to get to use the blade for very long, as he meet with a messy end at the hand of a small band of Tormtars in the Daggerdale area.  His blade was thought destroyed, but it would seem they thought wrong.
