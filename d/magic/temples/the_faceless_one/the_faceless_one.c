The world and all its treasures are open for the taking, for those of quick wit and subtle hands.  Do not be bound by the petty rules and standards of 'civilisation', for in the end they are merely illusions, a veneer of order to hide the true chaos that lies in every heart.  A deception can be as sharp a tool as a blade, and each has its uses.  Learn to blur the lines between truth and fiction, so that others may not perceive the difference; honesty is for fools, but apparent honesty is valuable indeed.  Force becomes unnecessary when others can be manipulated into action, or to thinking a decision is of their own free will.  Trust in the shadows, for the bright way makes for easy targets.
