%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^Kismet charges her followers with this message:
%^RESET%^%^CYAN%^Respect the weave above all things. The weave is simply an extension of your art, just as a paintbrush is to a painter, or clay to a sculptor. The weave is neither kind nor cruel, good nor evil. Accept the weave for what it is. All who seek this power shall be accepted under my wing. Seek knowledge, improve your arts, and serve the weave as an extension of me. Seek knowledge wherever you go and from all you meet. All knowledge, even the seemingly insignificant, is of great value. Destroy those who seek to ravage the world and disrupt the weave.

%^CYAN%^*NOTE:%^WHITE%^ Being an ally or enemy does not necessarily mean you must aid or kill on sight. Determine the best course of action for your character based on your character's beliefs, the other individual(s) in question, and past actions/interactions with the individual(s) and/or their faith.
