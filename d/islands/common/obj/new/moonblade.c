"and together a great weaving was made across the realms to bind all of the High Mages in solemn ceremony.\n"
"  And when it was done, it came to each clan's heir to take up the blade and be judged for their worthiness "
"to rule.  Within the blades was imbued the ability to grant power and protection to those of rightful morals, "
"and death to any other who attempted to harness their power.  Of the few hundred who stood forward at the "
"First Claiming Ceremony, near half their number perished, and dozens of Gold Elf houses stood humbled as "
"their heirs were judged unworthy to rule elvenkind.  And so they were named the Moonblades, for at the last, "
"greatest among those judged worthy were Moon Elf clans.\n"

"'When the blades number a score and four, they shall ring out the time for the Ascension Ceremony.  The one "
