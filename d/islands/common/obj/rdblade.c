This ornately crafted long sword is in near perfect condition. The %^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^adamantite %^RESET%^blade has a %^BOLD%^%^RED%^glowing red %^RESET%^hue about it, tracing up the razor sharp edges. The hilt of the blade looks to be two %^BOLD%^%^RED%^dragon %^RESET%^claws sitting apart from one another in a clutched grip. The handle of the blade is made of a set of flat %^BOLD%^%^RED%^rubies %^RESET%^that are layered in such a way to seem like you are gripping the scales of a dragon. The heavy pommel is made of dense %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^volcanic %^RESET%^rock, shaped into a eerily dark sphere.

Crafted by the great Artificer, Carcascus, the dragon blades were a tribute to the fourth King of Asgard, Stararach, nearly six centuries ago. The swords were rumored to have the power to control dragons of a specific type as well as slay them. After the collapse of the kings reign, Stararach's precious weapons were lost to history.
