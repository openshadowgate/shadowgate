straight down into the mouth of the volcano. A small chair scarred
with long scrapes and tears sits in the middle of the balcony.
This must be where the natives send "volunteers" to be sacrificed
to the god of the volcano. What could possibly answer such an
offer? The chair stands empty, you see it full of the brave who
would die to protect from what?
