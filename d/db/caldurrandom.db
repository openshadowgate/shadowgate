Austus is running a really nice bakery on the southwest side of the village.+The elven waybread is delightful.
If you are hurt you should visit the healer north of the center of the village.+Aravilar will take good care of you.
Watch yourself out in the forest.+There are many Malarite who would love to get their claws into you.+Lets be thankful we have rangers like Alveric and Aramel to work against them.
At least we do not have to deal with those evil drow around here.+&shudder+The orcs are bad enough as it is without having to deal with worse of all evils.
One day Laucian will get rid of those orcs once and for all.+I have faith in him.
$ makes sure everything is in order on his table.

Sometimes you have to pitty those poor half-humans.++They usually do not have good upbringing to the... tainted... blood.+Do not mistake me for generalizing them all. There are some like Vivian out there, but if you ask me, that is rare.
