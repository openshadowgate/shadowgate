		" became a large and powerful place that many people visited"+
		" from near and far.\n\n"+

		" the town he had once protected. Many of the citizens fled,"+
		" those who could not escape in time were turned into zombies"+
		" and other such horrors. Evil spread throughout the area,"+
		" polluting the forest and valley north of Antioch and many"+
		" evil creatures were drawn to the place.\n\n"+
		"But the citizens of the town refused to give up, and after"+
		" much searching the mages uncovered a way to free Ignatius."+
		" Not having the strength to do so themselves, they luckily"+
		" came across wondering adventurers who agreed to help. Several"+
		" specific elements had to be found within the surrounding"+
		" area and collected. The brave warriors even had to battle"+
		" Ignatius and defeat him in combat to steal his wand, which"+
		" was the key to his imprisonment. With the elements combined"+
		" the wand became powerful enough to free Ignatius from his"+
		" insanity and banish the evil powers who had ruled Antioch"+
		" for so long. The adventurers were rewarded and went on their"+
		" way and the remaining townsfolk gathered together and the"+
		" mages used the wand to cure Ignatius. The power of the"+
		" elements did free Ignatius, but it also destroyed all of"+
		" Antioch and killed many people.\n\n"+
		"Appalled at what he had allowed to occur, Ignatius begged"+
		" forgiveness from the townsfolk. He returned the surviving"+
		" citizens to normal and offered to help rebuild a new Antioch."+
		" They agreed to move the town to the west and with the aide"+
		" of magic a new town was quickly constructed.\n\n"+
		"Druids have moved into the northern valley and were trying"+
		" to restore balance to the forest, but evil still lurks"+
		" within its edges. The ruins of Antioch are also still rumored"+
		" to be plagued by horrible things. The new Antioch is a thriving"

		" visitors will always know the truth of what happened here.\n");
