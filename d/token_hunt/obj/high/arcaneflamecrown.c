%^RESET%^%^ORANGE%^This golden crown is forged from a single billet of pure yellow gold.  The metal has been shaped into form by a master of the craft as all indication of tool marks and joints have been completely removed.  In the front of the golden circlet a set of five %^MAGENTA%^black opals %^ORANGE%^have been set.  The largest, worn over the brow of the head, is at least as big as a child's hand and is oval in shape.  To either side of the large opal a set of crescent opals have been set, and beside these, thin tapered opals curve around to either side of the crown.  These opals glitter with a dark %^MAGENTA%^amethyst light %^ORANGE%^that flickers and reflects the light of the arcane flames that dance along the top of the crown.  Though cool to the touch, there is a powerful energy that constantly swirls and resonates within the ever shifting swirl of %^MAGENTA%^purple flames%^ORANGE%^.%^RESET%^

The crown of the arcane flame is said to have been forged by the "Lich of Attaya".  Though little is known of his origins, it is said he surfaced within the later half of the seventh century SG.  The lich having been defeated about the same time by a young band of heroes.  The crown purportedly is imbued with arcane knowledge and magics which only several life times worth of study could reveal.  The "Lich of Attaya" had such a life time and is considered one of the most powerful creatures to have ever been found upon the accursed island.  Though, considering what else makes its home in the barrens of Attaya, the truth of this statement is up for speculation.
