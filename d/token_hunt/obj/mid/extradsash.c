"%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^The mystical properties of the sash have been deeply examined by those of great power. In the tome entitled 'Grymoire of Artyfects in Powre' "
"by the ancient Tsarveni Vizier Verriliu the Sighted is perhaps the most detailed such examination. The sash is a gateway to a pocket reality that resembles "
"the Elemental Plane of Air. Anything placed within the sash hangs within this pocket reality by an azure string that disappears into forever. A wearer can "
"reach within and feel many strings. Instinctively the wear knows which strings attach to which items. Tugging a string is quickly followed by a small gust of "
"air that drops the item into the wearers hands.\n\n"
"%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^The creation of these wondrous sashes is a mystery for all time. A rare few stories hint at a grand wizard of the Old Elven Realm. Perhaps the "
