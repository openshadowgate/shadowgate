Goblins are noxious little creatures to be sure, but sometimes they come up with the most interesting of things.  In this case, a goblin slave trader who suffered a great loss when his entire inventory was lost to freak storm that set his wooden cages on fire and cooked the contents within.  That these were Alu-Tel-Quessir (sea elves) was at first seen as a great loss and he was nearly ruined because of it.  Except that he realized their scaly hides had been boiled and hardened by the fire.  So, in an effort to recoup his losses, he had the bodies skinned and used the metal pieces that were left over from the cage to make a large supply of footwear for a large goblin raiding party.
