Finely made garments are always in demand and those which are both beautiful and functional items are highly prized.  Many a nobleman has been known to seek garments which can conceal a few small vices, such a snuffbox or a smoking pipe and tobacco, all without loosing the trim look of the garment.  Those tailors that turn their skills to such efforts are often rewarded with repeat business and fame of their own as word spreads about their exceptional talent with cloth and leather.
