Uskatho Blielm is credited with making these types of gauntlets in the early third century.  Fascinated by the way that lizards moved and fought, he modeled several items after their lithe, quick shapes.  Of high interest to him were the small fire lizards that lived on his native island.  These little creatures were predominantly black in coloration but featured small bands of red spotting along their backs and a ruffle of bright red around the neck.  To mimic this coloration Uskatho created several of the items that came out of his workshop with similar markings.  Everything from the delicate ruffles to the dots of bright red ruby coloring.  It is said that he died a pauper due to his overwhelming reliance upon the ruby coloring, refusing to work with lesser stones such as agate.
