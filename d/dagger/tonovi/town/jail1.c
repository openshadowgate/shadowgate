//updated by Circe 11/24/04 with description and ideas by Lusell
//some code adapted from the Shadow jail
// converted to the new inheritable jail by *Styx* 9/2004

/* To change the waystations for the guards to finding the jail if needed...
* eval return "daemon/destinations_d.c"->query_waystations("/d/dagger/tonovi/town/jail1")
* eval return "/daemon/destinations_d.c"->clear_waystations("/d/dagger/tonovi/town/jail1")
* eval return "/daemon/destinations_d.c"->generate_waystations("/d/dagger/tonovi/town/jail1", 6, 3)  seemed to cover it decently without a horribly huge mapping
