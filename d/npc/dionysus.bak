Dionysus stands behind the bar, a large hulk of a man. Thick, meaty forearms
rest upon the countertop, as an ever-vigilant gaze sweeps the length of the
inn and back. His expression is pinched, the kind one finds extremely
difficult to read. He rarely speaks and appears to always be listening, a
trait prized among barkeeps. Occasionally wiping the countertop with a
towel as he takes order after order, he appears to be attending diligently
to the patrons.
