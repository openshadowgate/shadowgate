The words in %^BOLD%^<>%^RESET%^ are commands you should read the help files for.  Those will help you fully understand how they are meant to be used.  For instance, type 'help describe' to see the help file on descriptions.  Some of them may seem obvious, but how well you portray your character is VERY important to gaining respect as someone who is here to role-play.  This is not a hack and slash video game.  Role-play and interaction is expected and you will enjoy the experience much more if you take time to develop a vision of your character's looks, attitudes, and mannerisms.

You are expected to keep your <stats> (the numbers you assigned to characteristics such as charisma and dexterity), body type, race, alignment, etc. from creation in mind at all times and do your best to portray those consistently.  Setting your %^BOLD%^<adjective>%^RESET%^, in/out <message>(s), description, and even background will help you turn those attributes into a memorable character in the world of Shadowgate.

Please be sure to look at poster 3 for additional notes on proper use of adjectives.
