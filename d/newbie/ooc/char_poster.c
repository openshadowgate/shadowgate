This is a series of posters, each with a name by topic for easy reference.  They have been designed to help guide new ShadowGate players through learning commands and how to make a memorable character.  A little time spent now will help you have the most fun while here.  You can read them according to their topic (type '%^BOLD%^read overview%^RESET%^' etc.).  The topics are:

%^BOLD%^overview     %^RESET%^Overview for how you look to others (describe, adjective)
%^BOLD%^speech       %^RESET%^Customize your speech & using colors (speech, color, alias)
%^BOLD%^actions      %^RESET%^Actions, enter/leave rooms (message in/out, souls, emote)
%^BOLD%^descriptions %^RESET%^Guidelines/elaboration for descriptions and adjective use
%^BOLD%^deities      %^RESET%^The gods you can choose to follow (help deities).
