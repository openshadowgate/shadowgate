There are times in battle when you bite off more than you can chew, and you need to plan your retreat. Sometimes you need to heal or replenish your spells. You can choose to leave combat by leaving the room, but be warned that there is often a delay between the time you enter a direction, and the time you actually leave the room. Spamming a direction will assure this delay is even greater. 

You can set %^BOLD%^<wimpy [on [percent]]> %^RESET%^to automatically flee from combat when your hit points are reduced to the designated percentage.  You may not be able to leave the room due to having used stab, rush, etc. or other combat circumstances.  If you are feeling brave %^BOLD%^<wimpy off> %^RESET%^will turn it off.  Use %^BOLD%^<wimpydir (direction)> %^RESET%^to set the direction you will flee.  If the direction isn't set or isn't valid, you will flee in a random direction.  To check the current setting, just type <%^BOLD%^wimpydir%^RESET%^>.

Realizing it can be difficult to read and type the name of an attacker quickly enough to cast spells or otherwise target them with special attacks, we have %^BOLD%^%^RED%^"attacker" %^RESET%^for a generic id once you are in combat.  However, it only applies to those you have entered combat with.  It has a few limitations including a risk of getting a party member if an area spell has caused them to go into combat with you.  It also won't work on the (rare) opponent that stays invisible during combat.  So, once attacked, you can type "cast magic missile on attacker" or "flash attacker 2", etc. Learning to use the <%^BOLD%^alias%^RESET%^> and <%^BOLD%^nickname%^RESET%^> commands will be very helpful too, especially when dealing with long commands, spell names, or hard to type mob or player names.

You (or others) can %^BOLD%^<block exitname> %^RESET%^to try to keep someone from leaving that direction.  You can also %^BOLD%^<protect name> %^RESET%^to try to protect others with you and take (or deflect) hits aimed for them yourself.  This is often used for a fighter to protect the unarmored mage in the group, etc.
