%^YELLOW%^EQUIPMENT - Getting started%^RESET%^

You have some starting money, so visit the shops in town.  You'll likely need a lantern or torch sooner or later, even if you have infravision to see in the dark, and a few other things from the general store.  The shopkeepers will respond to many questions you may have, so try talking to them to find out what is suitable.  They are meant to help you have a feeling of roleplay as well as be helpful even when no other players are in the area to interract with.  The armor shop in Offestry will have basics for different sized races. Be sure to ask the shopkeeper to show you the armor you are thinking of buying, so that you can check whether it will fit you.

You will probably want some basic clothing, etc. for RP purposes even though they don't provide protection.  What you are carrying will save when you quit. Food and drinks will save as well, but be warned that consuming old perishables can lead to food poisoning.

You'll want to visit the healer and buy healing kits to carry along.  Even clerics will find there will be times they will need or want them.
