1: Golden Rules

   A> Immortals have created this game with a goal and vision in mind.
      This vision is the goal of their actions. Their reward comes from 
      the successfull movement toward this goal. Ultimately this goal is
      to make ShadowGate as successful a role playing environment and as
      near to Table top situation as possible in a MUD environment. Their
      actions are all geared toward the furtherance of this goal. 
      Therefore, immortals' words are final. They also can act outside of
      the rules listed here when it is in the best interest of the MUD. 
      Immortals are also human. They can act rashly and improperly. You 
      can appeal decisions made by an immortal to LAW. This can be done by 
MUD mailing law, or mailing garrett@firedragon.com. The word of law 
      is final.
      
   B> Players have the right to play the mud and enjoy themselves within 
      the scheme of the MUD. That means within the role playing, 
      functional, intended and logistic limits of the game. If you don't
      have fun playing D&D MUD, you do not have a right to make it fun for
      yourself by making it a cyber MUD. If you don't like role playing
      you do not have a right to simply not. If you want to RP and play a
      D&D mud you have a right to play here and have fun.
      
   C> In general, overt criticism of the MUD is unwanted and will result 
      in bad feeling. If you have suggestions as to improving the MUD or
      the playing environment please feel free to share it. We understand
      that we are not perfect and can always improve. However, like all 
      humans we do not appreciate simply being told we "suck".
