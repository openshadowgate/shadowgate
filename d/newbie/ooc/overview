%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^*OVERVIEW and HOW YOU APPEAR TO OTHERS*%^RESET%^

The words in %^BOLD%^<>%^RESET%^ are commands you should especially read the help files for.  Those will help you fully understand how they are meant to be used.  For instance, type <%^BOLD%^help describe%^RESET%^> to see the help file on descriptions.  Some of these may seem obvious, but how well you portray your character is VERY important to gaining respect as someone who is here to roleplay and make the game more enjoyable for everyone.  This is NOT a hack and slash video game.  Roleplay and interaction is expected, and you will enjoy the experience much more if you take time to develop a vision of your character's looks, attitudes, and mannerisms.

You are expected to keep your %^BOLD%^<stats>%^RESET%^ (the numbers you assigned to characteristics such as charisma and dexterity), body type, race, alignment, etc. in mind at all times and do your best to portray those consistently.  Setting your %^BOLD%^<adjective>%^RESET%^, in/out %^BOLD%^<message>%^RESET%^(s), description, and even background will help you turn those attributes into a memorable character in the world of Shadowgate.

For starters, you will want to %^BOLD%^<describe> %^RESET%^your character, set %^BOLD%^<adjective>%^RESET%^(s), %^BOLD%^<message>%^RESET%^(s) in and out, and your %^BOLD%^<speech> %^RESET%^emote fairly soon.
