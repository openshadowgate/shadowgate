/*===========================================================
Tutorial Object for Newbies - going to have it be a sentient helmet
that changes to either a wizard type hat/coif/or great helm when the tutorial
is completed - based on class

Basically though it is going to direct newbies to areas of the newbie area
to complete quests/tasks and will reward them with gear
as they complete them.

The idea being that newbies will have a set of decent gear when
they leave the newbie area - the helmet itself
will be the only enchanted item - at +1 and will
stay with them leveling up to +3 at level 20 (it will be slightly lower enchantment than what
they might be able to find out in the world).

Will reward experience based on what is needed to level up when the task/quest
is completed - so that by the time a player completes the tasks
they should be non-newbie - the very last task will
reward the updated helmet and spawn a version of a trainer
that is special for a newbie character.
