%^BOLD%^Scribe's Office in Tabor%^RESET%^
This well-kept office reflects the personality of the man who 
spends much of his life here.  The large desk against the 
eastern wall is made of exotic %^RED%^teak wood%^RESET%^ and is balanced 
by the matching, ornately carved %^RED%^chair %^RESET%^standing behind it.  
The chair has an %^BLUE%^indigo pad %^RESET%^that has become worn after 
years of use but is kept well-repaired.  A lone shelf to the right 
of the desk holds reams of %^BOLD%^paper %^RESET%^and jars of %^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^ink %^RESET%^while the 
rest of the office is rather bare.  A single picture is framed on 
the southern wall, a large portrait of %^YELLOW%^Tabor %^RESET%^with the mage 
tower prominent in the foreground.
