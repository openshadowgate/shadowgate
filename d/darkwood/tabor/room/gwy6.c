You are on %^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Gwydion Street %^RESET%^in Tabor before the %^GREEN%^Fields of Tempus%^RESET%^. The
%^GREEN%^Fields %^RESET%^appear to be a small fenced building with a large field that has
%^ORANGE%^sparring yards %^RESET%^and an %^BOLD%^archery range %^RESET%^for training of the Royal Army and
any who seek better skills with their weapons. To the northwest, you see
that what appears to be an %^ORANGE%^ancient road %^RESET%^that has recently been repaired 
and leads out of town.

%^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^There is a sign you can look at here.

%^WHITE%^There is a stone slab bearing a written message you should read.

%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Gwydion Street %^RESET%^continues to the east.
To the northwest is a quiet but well kept road that travels out of the city.
