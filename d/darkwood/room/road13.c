You are on the Royal Southern Road.  To the northwest, the road takes a 
path straight through the heart of the forest, while eastward the trees 
lighten.  From what you can tell, the forest is filled with a mixture of
coniferous and deciduous trees that seem to form a perfect canopy.  The 
forest looks unusually dark inside thanks to the cover of the trees.
