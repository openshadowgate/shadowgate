You are on the Royal Southern Road entering a dark forest.  The light
of the sun is almost blotted out by the near-perfect shade of the trees
all round you.  The thick growth of bushes beneath the trees looks as 
thought it might be hiding any number of unsavory creatures.  Just to 
the southeast, it seems that the road is heading out of the forest, and 
the light in that direction beckons you forward.
