Nightmare Mudlib 3.2 SimulEfun: log_file()

void log_file(string, mixed);

DESCRIPTION
The first argument is the name of a file under the MUD's log directory
as defined in /adm/include/dirs.h.  The text which is the second argument
is written to that file.  Logging using this SimulEfun is subject to the MUD's
security for the log directory in question.  In other words, secure log
directories require logging objects to have an euid represented by the
define in security.h UID_LOG or UID_ROOT.  Any object may log to non-secure
log directories (like the reports directory).

EXAMPLE
log_file("enter", (string)this_player()->query_name()+" (quit): "+
  ctime(time()));
This will log to the file /log/enter (assuming /log is the log dir) the text
of the second argument.
