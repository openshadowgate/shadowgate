Multiple characters are now partially legal...however, you must
mail Manny specifying what two characters you are playing (Cannot
be more than 2!).  Please include the name and class of the extra
character when you mail him and also make sure that the email
addresses of the two characters match.  Also, if you know if your
site is on registration, that would be very helpful.
You may NEVER log both of these characters
on at the same time (There is an ENTER log, beware).
You may not trade items between your two characters (this includes coins).
Your second character may not post threats to other guilds.
Be sure to mail MANNY and not Forlock about your second characters.
If you even CC it to Forlock it'll probably be denied.
Your second character may not either vote nor run in the elections
(We will keep track of this in logs also).  Your second character
may also NOT become wizard, only your primary character can do this.
 
All of these restrictions are now enforced by code.  You cannot
log in your second character within an hour of when you logged out
your first one.  Also, be sure to wait until Manny sends a 
response before you attempt to create your second character.
Questions to me.
