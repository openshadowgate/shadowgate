Part 1: The Basic Room
-----------------------

The basic room looks like this:
******

inherit "std/room";

void create() {
    ::create();
    set_property("indoors", 1);
    set_property("light", 2);
    set("short", "The Praxis Inn");
    set("long",
	"Welcome to the Praxis Inn.\n"+
	"The only exit is south onto the street.\n"
    );
    set_items( ([ "inn": "The inn is a beautiful place.", 
      "street":"Boc La Road.", "exit":"It leads out to Boc La Road>" ]) );
    set_exits( ([ "south" : "/d/standard/e_boc_la3" ]) );
}

******

In this example, You have a room with a single exit.  You must have all of
these functions in your code to create any room.  It is true that you can omit
the set_exits and set_items functions and still have a viable
room, but it is very rare indeed that you have a room set with no exits and
on Nightmare, you should have every noun in the room description given an
item description.  Here is what all of these functions do:

::create();
    The :: is an operator like +. -. *, etc.  It means the function which
    follows is down the inheritance tree one level.  In this example, it
    means it is calling the create() function in room.c.  You use this syntax
    when there might be confusion as to which function you mean.

set_property("indoors", 1);
        Means that the room is inside.  Hence players will not be able to
        see the sun or moon or be rained on.  Omitting this or setting it to
        0 will make it an outside room.  Outside rooms get dark at night and
        fun stuff like that.           

set_property("light", 2);
 	Sets the value of light available to players in that room, not taking
	into account torches and the such.  Light values are generally within 
	the range of -5 to 5, where 0 is where a human cannot see but function,
	and -1 causes a human to loose all functionality.  Remeber, however,
	that there are races with the ability to see in the dark.  See
	/doc/build/etc/light for a further description of light values and
	what they mean.

set("short","The Praxis Inn");
	This is the thing a player in brief mode will see upon entering a room
	or typing "glance".  It is simply a short description of what the room
	is.

set("long","The Praxis Inn.  People come here to rest.  The exit is south.");
	A more verbose description of the room.  Often there will be subtle
	clues as to any special things a player can do in the room here,
	for instance, you might say "There is a crack in the south wall. ".
	In this case, you might allow the player to enter the crack to go to
	a different room.  Note how a long room description in the basic room
	example was broken up using the ability to add strings.
        NOTE: The Nightmare Mudlib now wraps text to fit the screens of
              each individual player, so you should only put in carriage
              returns (\n) when you specifically want them to break there.

set_items( ([ "inn": "A place for people to rest." ]) );
        This function is very important to making your room interesting to
        players.  It allows players to look at items which are described
        somehow in your room, but yet which do not physically exist inside
        the room.  For example, in the room description, you may mention
        the existence of a desk.  There is no point in actually placing a desk
        object in the room since it does nothing special, but you want someone
        to be able to look at it.  Perhaps you might even want to add
        something that allows players to pull something out of it, nevertheless,
        it is still a simple waste to add another object in the room.  The 
        set_items() allows you to add descriptions to the room.  You use
        a mapping as the argument, where you have ([ "item": "description"])
        set_items( ([ "house":"It is a nice house.", 
          "window":"It is fogged up." ]) );
        When you type "look at house", you see the house description.  
        Similarly, when you type "look at window", you see the window one.
        In addition, if you have many items with the same description, you
        can do this:
          set_items( (["house":"It is a nice house",
            ({ "candles", "candle"}):"It is a nice set of candles." ]) );
        So therefore you can use an array of strings instead of a
        single string to specify which items are being described.

set_exits( ([ "south" : "/d/standard/e_boc_la3" ]) );
        This function passes a data type called a mapping.  What it does is
        associate the value "/d/standard/e_boc_la3" with a value called a key,
        which here is "south".  In practical terms, it says that the exit
        south is /d/standard/e_boc_la3.  There may be any number of exits 
        added to a room.

All of these functions are placed within the definition of a function called
create.  create() is called whenever a room is first loaded into memory.
All of the above functions which you are calling from inside create have
been pre-defined for you in the file /std/room which you access in the
first line:
	inherit "std/room";

That is it for a basic room.  It's purpose is simply to link complex rooms as
basic rooms should not be the basis of an area.  Too often immortals brag
about having a 500 room area.  It will turn out that 400 rooms are just basic
rooms.  There is nothing on this earth more boring than an area full of basic
rooms.  But they are necessary, and a proper combination of basic rooms with
complex rooms is what makes for a neat area.

*****************************************************************************

Part 2: adding new actions
---------------------------

In many rooms, you will want players to be able to do more than look, look at,
and use the exits.  You will want them to be able to do such things as climb
a wall, or perhaps pray at an altar.  To do all of this, you must call the
function add_action() from inside a function you define called init().
This is what it looks like:

*****

void init() {
    ::init();
    add_action("climb_fun", "climb");
}

*****

If you remember from part 1, the function create() was called when the room
got loaded into memory. init() gets called by each player when the player
enters the room.  In this way, any new commands a player might need for a room
(or for any other object, for that matter) can be given to the player.
The function that actually adds commands to the player is add_action();
In this particular example, the function first calls ::init();
The file "std/room" already has a function called init() in it.  This
predefined init() is what adds the directional commands from set_exits() to
the player.  To be able to add those commands as well as the ones you want
to add to the player, you MUST call ::init();  The :: tells the driver to
call the function defined in the inherited code instead of the function
defined in the current code.

add_action("climb_fun", "climb");
	This function adds the commands "climb" to the player's list of
	available commands.  Whenever the player types the command "climb",
	the driver will call the function climb_fun(), and it will search
	for it in your room code.  In addition, the driver will pass as
	an argument to the function anything the player types on the command
	line besides "climb".  For instance, if the player types "climb rope",
	the driver will pass the string "rope" to the function climb_fun();

After having defined init(), you need to go on to defined climb_fun().
A sample climb_fun() might look like this:

*****

int climb_fun(string str) {
    if(!str) {
	notify_fail("Climb what?\n");
	return 0;
    }
    if(str != "rope") {
	notify_fail("You can't climb that!\n");
	return 0;
    }
    write("You slip trying to climb the rope!");
    say(this_player()->query_cap_name()+" slips trying to climb the rope!", this_player());
    this_player()->add_hp(-5);
    return 1;
}

*****

There are several parts to any function called by a player command.  The first
part is testing to see if the command was really supposed to call THIS
function.  For example, a command in a room might be "read".  But a player
could also have several objects which have the command "read" as well.  So
you always check the string argument to see what the player meant when the
command was typed.  Very few commands should be allowed without passing
arguments.  Here is what the following lines of the above code do:

if(!str) { notify_fail("Climb what?\n"); return 0; }

When a function is called by a player command, it is expected to return a 1 or
a 0.  A 1 means that this function was the function that the player meant to
call.  A 0 means that either the player probably meant to use another function,
or the player was using this one in an ambiguous manner.  (Success or failure).
notify_fail() is a function that changes the error message for the player.
The default error message is the ever so loved "What ?".  Any time you
return 0 in a function (well almost any time) you should change that error
message.  You use notify_fail() to do this.  Why use notify_fail() instead of
write()?  Because notify_fail() will not be written to the player if another
function returning 1 is found.  For instance, the room has a list in it to
be read, and the player is carrying a book.  The player types <read book>.
The driver finds that indeed there is a read command for the player, and it
calles the function read_list() in the room (it searches in the order the 
commands were added to the player). It executes read_list(), which tests
to see if "book" == "list", which is false.  A notify_fail() is then
executed changing "What ?" to "Read what?", and then 0 is returned.  The
"Read what?" is not yet written to the screen, as the driver has not searched
all of the player's commands.  It then finds that there is a read_book()
function in the player's book, which gets executed successfully returning 1.
"Read what?" is therefore never seen by the player.  If you had used
write(), it would have written to the player "Read what?" AND executed
the read_book.  Or if you had done write("Read what?\n"); return 1;, it would
have written "Read what? to the player without ever having executed the 
read_book() which was the player's intention.
The second part of a function called by player command is the actual execution
of the act intended, in this case the climbing of the rope.  After that is
completed, you return 1; and are done.

You can use init() to do things other than add_action(), such as throw out
players who should not be entering that room and such.

*************************************************************************

Part 3: The function reset()
-----------------------------

Besides create() and init(), there is one last function that you may sometimes
needs to define which the driver searches for in your code.  It is reset().
reset() is called everytime there is a reset.  If your room never changes in
character, then you do not need to define this function.  But you might have
a monster which needs to regenerate every reset, or something else which
needs to set back to the rooms original situation at reset.  You do this in
the following way:

First you define the reset() as follows:

*****

void reset() {
    ::reset();
    if(!present("ogre")) new("obj/mon/ogre")->move(this_object());
}

*****

At each reset, reset() is called and checks to see if the ogre is still in the
room from the last reset.  If it is not there, then it makes one.
The function ::create() in room.c calls reset() for the first time to
set up the room.

******************************************************************************

Part 4: item manipulation
--------------------------

You have already learned how to set_items();
It happens, however, that items in some rooms may change during the course of
the game.  For instance, in the inn, certain rooms on list of rooms may
become unavailable, so the list needs to be able to change.  The following
functions allow you to manipulate items:

set_items( ([ "item" : "description" ]) );
add_item("item", "description");
remove_item("item");

set_items() was described above.  But say, when the player tries
climbing the rope, the rope disintegrates, you need to remove the item rope
from the list of items.  In the climb_fun(), you have it defined this way:

*****

int climb_fun(string str) {
    if(!str) {
	notify_fail("Climb what?\n");
	return 0;
    }
    if(str != "rope") {
	notify_fail("You can't climb that!\n");
	return 0;
    }
    if(!id("rope")) {
	notify_fail("That is not here!\n");
	return 0;
    }
    write("The rope disintegrates as you attempt to climb it.");
    say("The rope disintegrates as "+this_player()->query_cap_name()+" tries to climb it.", this_player());
    remove_item("rope");
    return 1;
}

*****

And in your reset():

*****

void reset() {
    ::reset();
    add_item("rope", "You might be able to climb it.");
}

*****

Every time the room resets, there will be a rope in the room for a player to
look at and climb.  Once a player uses the "climb" command correctly, however,
the rope will be taken out of the room.  If a player tries to look at the rope,
they will get the default message as if you had never had "rope" in the items.
In addition, if the player tries to climb the rope which does not exist now,
the player will be informaed that there is no rope in the room.  

But some items change instead of disappear.  Take for instance the list of
rooms available in the inn.  You would not put "list" in the list of items
in set_items() with a static description.  You would instead use a function
which tests which rooms are available and return descriptions based on
room availability.  Instead of a string, you therefore use a function
for the description:
      set_items( ([ "list": (: this_object(), "look_at_list" :) ]) );
When the player types "look at list" or "examine list", the driver will
call the function look_at_list(), which might be defined like this:

*****

string look_at_list(string str) {    /* str will = "list" */
    if(full) return "The list says that there are no rooms available.";
    else return "The list says that there are plenty of rooms free.";
}

*****

In this function, it is assumed that you have declared an integer variable 
called full that is 1 when no rooms are available and 0 when there are rooms
the player can rent. Similar to the way set_items() allows functions, add_item()
also does, and remove_item() will remove those items as well.

*******************************************************************************

Part 5: Manipulating exits
-----------------------------

The set_exits() command has add_ and remove_ counterparts similar to those
described above for item descriptions in part 4. For example:

inherit "std/room";

int blocked;

void init() {
    ::init();
    add_action("kick", "kick");
}

void create() {
    ::create();
    set_property("light", 1);
    set_property("indoors", 1);
    set("short","A room with a table");
    set("long","You are in a huge empty room with a table in it.");
    set_items( ([ "room":"It is huge.", 
      "table" : (: this_object(), "table" :) ]) );
    set_exits( ([ "south": "/d/standard/room3" ]) );
}

void reset() {
    ::reset();
    add_exit("/d/standard/room1", "north");
    blocked = 0;
}

int kick(string str) {
    if(!str || str != "table") {
	notify_fail("Kick what?\n");
	return 0;
    }
    write("You kick the table across the room, and it blocks the north exit.");
    say(this_player()->query_cap_name()+" kicks the table to block the exit.", this_player());
    remove_exit("north");
    blocked = 1;
    return 1;
}

string table(string str) {
    if(blocked) return "It is blocking the north exit.";
    else return "It is in the middle of the room.";
}

*****

Hopefully, this example will demonstrate to you everything we have so far
gone over.  But there is more to exits that adding or removing them.  Sometimes
you may want to call a function before or after the player leaves the room. 
You might even want to prevent the player from leaving.  These are the
functions which allow you to do so:

set_pre_exit_functions( ({"north" }), ({"go_north"}) );
set_post_exit_functions( ({ "south" }), ({ "go_south" }) );
add_pre_exit_function( "north", "go_north" );
add_post_exit_function("south", "go_south");
remove_pre_exit_function("north");
remove_post_exit_function("south");

When you set a pre_exit_function for a given direction, that function gets
called any time a player tries to go in that direction before they go that
way.  In the following case:

set_pre_exit_functions( ({"north"}), ({"go_north"}) );

The function go_north() is called when the player types "north".
You define go_north() in your room, and return 1 if the player may proceed to
the exit set for north in set_exits, or you return 0 if the player is not
allowed to leave. For example:

*****

int go_north() {
    if(present("ogre")) {
	write("The ogre blocks your way!");
	return 0;
    }
    else return 1;
}

*****

In this example, if the ogre is in the room, the player cannot proceed to
the exit to the north.  But if the player has killed the ogre, then the 
player may indeed go to the north exit.  The remove_ and add_ functions
work as the remove_ and add_ for the items.

There are two differences between pre_exit_functions and post_exit_functions.
1) The pre_ ones get called before the player leaves the room and the _post
	ones get called after the player has left the room.
2) The pre_ ones are type int and return a 1 or 0.  The post ones are type
	void and return no value, since the player has already left the room.

The last functions involving the exits are:

set_invis_exits( ({"north", "south"}) );
add_invis_exit("east");
remove_invis_exit("north");
skip_obvious();

These functions simply leave the exits out of the list of obvious exits.
For instance, the following:
        set_exits((["north":"/d/standard/room1","south":"/d/standard/room2"]));
Will have the following description printed at the end of the long description:
	There are two obvious exits: north and south.
But maybe you want the south exit not listed, but you still want it to exist
without going through all of the trouble of an add_action().  You would do this
	set_invis_exits( ({"south"}) );
And the long description would say instead at the end:
	There is one obvious exit: north.

Finally, the function skip_obvious() simply has the room description
omit all obvious exits.

******************************************************************************

Part 6: Senses
-------------------

There are several default commands that are added automatically to every
room by the file /std/room.  Among them are all normal direction commands
and the command "search".  You change some tof the functions when you 
set_exits, so that instead of getting "You can't go that way." you get
moved to the exit.  The default setting for search is "You find nothing
special.\n".  But this too, you can change with the following

set_search("item", "string");
set_search("item", (: object, string :) );

This makes it possible for a player to search a particular item and for
something to happen.  If you just want whatever to happen when "search" alone
is typed, you replace "item" with "default".

The second example has you passing as a second argument a function.
This allows you to call a function by the name represented by the
string in the object named.  Thus:
set_search("default", (: this_object(), "search_default" :));
will call the function search_default() in your room so that you 
can define what happens in better detail  rather than simply print
a string.

set_smell("default", "The odors of the sea fill the air.");
set_smell("cat", (: this_object(), "smell_cat" :));
set_listen("cat", "You hear the purring of the sweet kitty.");
set_listen("default", (: this_object(), "default_listen" :) );

Notice that set_smell() and set_listen() are used much like set_search().
There are a couple of interesting properties about set_smell() and
set_listen() however:

1) default listens and smells automatically show up when a player looks or
enters a room... This allows for a description for an environment even though
the room may be dark or something.  It is recommended that ALL rooms make use
of default smells and sounds.

2) The user defined functions return a string to be printed.  This for
"smell_cat" and "default_listen" above, you would create in your room
the functions:
string smell_cat(string str);     string default_listen(string str);

The parameter being passed, str, is whatever the person is smelling or
listening to.  This can allow you to define multiple smells and listens
to use one function.  But that is a bit advanced.  Here is a minimal
example of a properly defined smell_cat() function:

In create():
    set_smell("cat", "smell_cat");

Then somewhere you define:
string smell_cat(string str) {
    if((string)this_player()->query_race() == "klingon")
      return "You smell fear in the pathetic human companion.";
    else return "You smell the contentment in the cute feline.";
}

*****************************************************************************

Part 7: Adding objects
-----------------------------------

There are two ways to put things in a room.  You can simply code a ready
made object, like the ogre shown above in the part on the reset function, or
you can take a generic file and tailor it to your individual needs.  At
any rate, when you do this depends upon when you want the object to go into
the room.  Do you want it to regenerate every reset?  Or do you want it to
be put in the room only when the player searches the room for something?

Most of the time, you will do it at reset.  How to do a ready-made monster
was already described above in the section on reset().  Doing any ready
made object is just like that.  

*****

void reset() {
    object mon;

  ::reset();
  if(!present("ogre")) {
    mon = new("std/monster");
    mon->set_name("ogre");
    mon->set_level(5);
    mon->set("short", "An ogre");
    mon->set("long", "An ugly ogre.\n");
    mon->set_race("ogre");
    mon->set_alignment(-300);
    mon->set_hp(100);
    mon->set_humanoid();
    mon->set_aggressive(10);
    mon->move(this_object());
  }
}
                    
******************************************************************************

Part 8: Using light
--------------------

Since the addition of a Nightmare clock, we now have daytime and nighttime.
So, now you have to declare that a room is an indoor room if you want it not
to get dark at night.  But, you can also use a few functions to give a room
different long descriptions when it is day or night.  These are:

set("day long", "It's bright and sunshiny.\n");
set("night long", "It's dark and spooky.\n");
set_property("indoors", 1);  /* indoors */
set_property("indoors", 0);  /* outdoors */

You can use these to make a better room.  Here are two nicer create() functions
using the new calls.

void create() {
   ::create();
   set_property("indoors", 1);
   set_property("light", 2);
   set("long", "This is a very nice sitting room.  There is a couch on the "
       "north wall that has a nice view out the huge window on the south "
       "wall.");
   set("day long", "The sun is streaming in the huge window on the south "
       "wall, bathing the couch across from it in warm sun beams.");
...
}

void create() {
    ::create();
   set_property("indoors", 0);
   set_property("light", 2);
   set("long", "Two paths diverge here around a large oak that looks like a "
       "great tree to nap under. ");
   set("night long", "The twist of dark branches of this massive oak tree "
       "guard the two paths that stretch into the blackness. ");  
...
}

As you can see, these can make a boring rooms much more interesting.  Remember
the value of descriptive language in the mud.  Since there are no pictures, try
to make your language paint a picture.
******************************************************************************

Part 9: Random Monster Encounters
---------------------------------

Kai@Shadowgate has added a random monster function to the rooms.

do_random_encounters(({string monsterfile,...}),int percentage,
			int max_num_of_monsters);
The <monsterfile> is the complete path and filename of the monster file's.
It is an array of strings.
The <percentage> is a number between 1 and 99. This will set the chance 
of an encounter.
The <max_num_of_monsters> is an int. This tells the fun the max number of
monsters to add to the room.
This fun is used in the init() function of the room. 
An Example:

void init(){
do_random_encounters(({"/d/shadow/mon/orc","/d/shadow/mon/orc_captian"}),80,12);
}

This will add orcs, and orc_captians to the room, 80% of the time, up to 
a maximum of 12 monsters(mixed count).

The random encounters fun has a treasure efun built into it, which will 
add some treasure to the random monsters, dependant on the monsters level.
The random treasure generator will add money, or items, or magic items.
If you have items to add to the store for the generator, please contact 
Melnmarn, for approval and implementation.

This is a real nice efun, it enables you to have monsters in you area's, 
that are constantly changing in numbers and treasure. This will make 
area's more challanging, and interesting.

You are encouraged to use this efun. 

***************************************************************************

Part 10: Climbing and Descending
-------------------------------

I have added an efun for climbing walls/cliffs as well as descending them.
Using the PHB standards, this efun allows 2 additional exits to rooms.
These exits are 'climb' and 'descend'. Climb is for upward movement, using 
walls, cracks, crevices, ropes and tools, other than ladders and staircases.
Descend is for downward movement using the same devices as climb. 
All users can use these exits, although non-thiefs need climbing tools.

Syntax:  set_climb_exits(([
    string direction:({string path,int difficulty,int damage,int distance})
	]))
IE:
	set_climb_exits(([
		"climb":({"d/shadow/room/shaft",3,6,300}),
		"descend":({"d/shadow/room/pit",5,18,100}),
	]));

Ok, first we have the verb, 'climb' or 'descend'. Then we have a mixed
array with:
1st: the path the exit leads to.
2nd: the difficulty level of the object being climbed.
3rd: extra damage done if the player falls, due to spikes, etc..
4th: the distance of the climb. 

The path is self explainitory. 
The difficulty has 7 levels.
     easiest		1:  rope and wall
	|		2:  abundant handholds / tree with limbs / rope, no wall.
	|		3:  sloped outward / not quite straight up
	|		4:  normal wall / straight up
	|		5:  slightly slippery / loose rocky walls
	|		6:  slipperly / crumbling walls
 nearly impossible	7:  icey

The Extra Damage is for damage inflicted on a fall, that is over and 
above the damage from the fall, hitting the floor. For example, if there are
spikes at the bottom of the fall, they will do extra damage to the player
who falls on them. A player will suffer 1d6 damage for every 100 feet they
fall, plus damage due to spikes or what erev obstical you have them land on.
The number you put here is the size of dice that will be rolled. IE set to
8, it will roll an extra 1d8 of damage for the player.
Players can be killed, from falling.

And lastly, the Distance. This is the distance from the top of the wall
to the bottom. it should be in 100 feet increments. so anything below 100
feet will be put as 100 feet. For every 100 feet, the player is checked
for successfully climbing/descending that section. If they fail, but don't 
fall off, they will climb/descend back to the place they started. However,
if they fall, they will suffer 1d6 damage for every 100 feet they 
successfully climbed to that point, where they fell. 
For example, if a player is scaling up a 600 foot cliff, makes it 400 
feet before slipping and falling, they will fall 400 feet and suffer 4d6 
damage.

set_fall_desc(string desctiption);

This will set your description, which will be called whenever the player 
falls. Good for those spiked floors, so you can describe the reason for 
all the damage, they receive.

And that is all there is to room building!  Now you can do anything necessary
to make an interesting area in conjunction of course with the proper knowledge
of weapon, armour, and simple object building.
