[1mNAME[0m
       command() - execute a command as if given by the object


[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       int command( string str, object ob );


[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       Execute  'str'  for  object  'ob', or this_object() if 'ob' is omitted.
       Note that the usability of the second argument  is  determined  by  the
       local administrator and will usually not be available, in which case an
       error will result.  In case of failure,  0  is  returned,  otherwise  a
       numeric  value  is  returned, which is the LPC "evaluation cost" of the
       command.  Bigger numbers mean higher cost, but the whole scale is  sub‐
       jective and unreliable.
