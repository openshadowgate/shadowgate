[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       dump_socket_status()  is  a diagnostic facility which displays the cur‐
       rent status of all LPC sockets configured into the MudOS driver.  It is
       useful  for debugging LPC sockets applications.  Each row in the output
       corresponds to a single LPC socket.  The first row corresponds  to  LPC
       socket descriptor 0, the second row, 1, etc.  The total number of sock‐
       ets is configured when the driver is built.

       The first column "Fd" is the operating system file  descriptor  associ‐
       ated  with the LPC socket.  "State" is the current operational state of
       the LPC socket.  "Mode" is the socket mode, which is passed as an argu‐
       ment to socket_create().  The local and remote addresses are the Inter‐
       net address and port numbers in Internet dot notations.  '*'  indicates
       an  address  or  which  is  0.  N.B. LPC sockets that are in the CLOSED
       state are not currently in use; therefore the data displayed  for  that
       socket may be idiosyncratic.

       The  following  output  was generated on Portals, where the only socket
       application running at the time was MWHOD.  It indicates that two sock‐
       ets  are  current in use, one is listening for connection requests on a
       STREAM mode socket.  The other is waiting for incoming data on a  DATA‐
       GRAM mode socket.
