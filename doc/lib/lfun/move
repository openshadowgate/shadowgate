Nightmare mudlib lfun: move()

int move(mixed dest);

This function handles what happens when an object is being moved by another
object.  The MudOS driver only allows the move_object() efun to move an
object when it is moving itself.

*****
note:

You might want to do the following if you need to know things
like if the move could not occur because it is not allowed or if the
player was too encumbered:

#include <move.h>

The following are the return codes

MOVE_OK		Everything went just peachy :) (This is 0 btw)
MOVE_NOT_ALLOWED This object is either immobile or is being blocked
MOVE_NO_ROOM	The player or object to which the object is being moved is
		"full", most often too encumbered.
MOVE_DESTRUCTED Never seen or heard of this being returned.
MOVE_NO_DEST	The target object does not exist.

*****
example:

This code might appear in the reset() function of a room:

void reset() {
    if(present("monster")) return;
    ob = new("/wizards/descartes/monster");
    ob->move(this_object());
}

Also note:

...
    ob = new("/wizards/descartes/sword");
    if(ob->move(this_player())) {    /* Ack! something wrong */
	write("You drop the sword.\n");
	say(this_player()->query_cap_name()+" drops the sword.\n");
	ob->move(environment(this_player()));
    }
...

In the second example, the first move() returned MOVE_NO_ROOM,
(or at least you can safely assume that), so you let the player
know that he/she was way too encumbered, and move the object to the room.
