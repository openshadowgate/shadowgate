%^CYAN%^Please %^ORANGE%^carefully read the PK rules before you decide to engage in Playerkilling (PK)%^RESET%^

%^CYAN%^ 0.%^RESET%^ PK is optional, new players may choose to drop or not to drop their PK flag, and ones that lost it can request permanent %^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^NoPK%^RESET%^ flag from staff member. Enter this realm of murder on your own peril and be ready to accept the consequences.

%^CYAN%^ 1.%^RESET%^ Don't engage in PK if either party has a %^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^NoPK%^RESET%^. If you witness a PK situation and you have a %^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^NoPK%^RESET%^ flag on, you can either immediately drop the %^BOLD%^%^MAGENTA%^NoPK%^RESET%^ flag and possibly join in, or you can leave the room.

%^CYAN%^ 2.%^RESET%^ Pick on someone worthy of your own size, i.e. don't kill far below your level. There is a way for you to tell the difference between character levels integrated into %^ORANGE%^<who>%^RESET%^ and %^ORANGE%^<levelcheck>%^RESET%^ commands, be sure to read %^ORANGE%^<help levelcheck>%^RESET%^ and %^ORANGE%^<help who>%^RESET%^ to familiarize yourself with them. However, if lower level is instigating PK interactions you are expected to use the %^ORANGE%^<threaten>%^RESET%^ command first, and if the lower-level player continues course of their actions, you will then be allowed to engage in PK.

%^CYAN%^ 3.%^RESET%^ Remember about rule #1. In all of your PK interactions, please keep in mind there is a legitimate, living breathing human being on the other side of the screen. Always try to give them the best experience possible. Some examples: it's very much not-fun to leave your victim unconscious for long spans of time. Looting someone for no other reason than to cause OOC grief makes you a dick. Looting someone naked makes you the biggest dick.

%^CYAN%^ 4.%^RESET%^ It is forbidden to use level scaling to escape player kill situations. However you're not allowed to start PK with scaled character without following previous rules and using %^ORANGE%^<threaten>%^RESET%^. You shouldn't also use level scaling to engage with lower levels.

%^CYAN%^ 5.%^RESET%^ To prevent people from using idling and loging out as a shield, do not log or idle out, or go inactive for 30 minutes after last pk interraction, unless you ask and get an affirmative response, or there is an emergency. If 30 minute timer is up, either party is considered escaped and is free to log out. This rule covers battles with extensive teleportation.

%^CYAN%^ 6.%^RESET%^ A player may opt out from roleplay that follows if it involves traumatic experience, e.g. torture, and call in %^CYAN%^fade to black%^RESET%^, you are absolutely must respect it. In such case you must agree between yourselves the consequences of the traumatic experience. You both will be expected to RP the consequences. If you call %^CYAN^fade to black%^RESET%^, and your attacker continues on, you are allowed to disconnect and quit. If this happens, please contact staff via %^ORANGE%^<lawmail>%^RESET%^. Refer to %^ORANGE%^<help fade to black>%^RESET%^ for more details.

CYAN%^ 7.%^RESET%^ Revenge killing (Killing a player because they killed you) and mulit-killing (Killing the same character a bunch of times, either yourself or by a proxy) is illegal, and will be considered harassment.

CYAN%^ 8.%^RESET%^ If you're killed, first of all, take a deep breath. For the next hour you'll character will be locked to special death area. Take the time to gather yourself, eat a cookie or two. After resurrection, follow guidelines in %^ORANGE%^<pk interactions>%^RESET%^ as a guide on how to proceed. %^CYAN%^If you hated the experience, consider following rule no. 0.%^RESET%^
