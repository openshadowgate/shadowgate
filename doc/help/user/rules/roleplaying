ShadowGate's interpretation of Role playing
===========================================

Role Playing is the total assumption of a role separate from 
that of your own. This implies that you become the person you are 
playing. This entails when entering the virtual world of ShadowGate
you become totally the character you are playing, assuming that 
characters attributes including intelligence, age, etc. You should 
also completely leave the real world behind. Forget who you are IRL
and become Conan or Grimsaddle or Fletch. Conversely, when you log
out of the MUD you should leave it behind. Don't take the mud to RL
just as you don't take RL to the MUD. Two different worlds, two 
different people.

When Rolling your character you are given ample opportunity to affect 
attributes of the character. When a character is completed we assume 
that you will take on all the attributes you have. For example, if Fletch 
the archer rolled a 3 charisma, we expect that his description and 
personality should reflect this (note we don't use comeliness so charisma 
encompasses appearance). We have age, weight, height here. All these things
should be considered when RPing. 

Alignment is an important part of your character. When you choose an 
alignment on ShadowGate, you are declaring the way your character
thinks morally and politically. It declares the nature of your
thought and actions upto the point of your creation (note that you could
have had 8 to 500 years of life before entering the realms of adventure)
Alignments should guide your character's thoughts. It should guide 
your character's actions. This isn't to say that a Evil person can't
do something good, but the reason for doing that good should be clear.

Interactions on SG are what make the RP. Your interactions should be
driven by your personality. Remember to leave RL in RL, assume the 
other person will do the same. Interactions are real to THIS world.
That means that any type of interaction possible in the REAL world
could theoretically be done in THIS world. When interacting with 
people, remember its your character and their character. There is
no connection to the real world and your person. 

Interactions of any sort that are within the bounds of RP are legal.
However, some may make people feel uncomfortable and take the fun of 
the game away. That person can at that point, through any means 
necessary, make a statement along the lines of "OOC I am not comfortable
with this". The other person/people involved should at this point
STOP, immediately and forthwith. Any actions that are being taken
can then be assumed to have been completed and everyone can RP 
from that point, or the line of RP can be dropped entirely. If you
do not STOP at this point, this is would be considered a violation 
of the Role-playing standards. You would be subject to multiple forms
of punishment. If someone does not stop please send the complaint 
with log to an administrator. Note, this is a situation that 
quitting out is acceptable. 

Please note that using OOC information or actions is also a violation
of the RP standards. For example, using an outside chat method to 
communicate with a fellow mudder, using quit to escape from a legit
RP situation. 

We truly feel that fun is achieved when you play a single character 
to the maximum of the mud's capabilities. The more the mud becomes
a community the more the mud will feel real and the more fun it
will be. All your MUD experiences should shape your character. 
This means playing through bad ones as well as good ones. If
you were to RP yourself into a bad situation and then give up
on the character, what have you accomplished? How will your 
character grow?

Finally, we are always looking for ways to improve the role play
on the mud. Always feel free to main constructive suggestions to
