While "fighter" may be a term often used out of character, few characters would actually consider themselves such.  They might think of themselves as soldiers, mercenaries, protectors, generals, and so on.  To this end, a fighter may choose the particular style of fighting in which he or she was trained from the following list.

%^BOLD%^Peasant %^RESET%^- The peasant fighter is the most common.  He is the warrior trained in the fields defending his home or town from invasion.  He is the member of a small town militia that received litle to no formal training.  The peasant fighter often uses whatever methods are most handy, occasionally having a few impressive maneuvers.

%^RED%^Thug %^RESET%^- The thug is just that.  He is the warrior who - most likely from a peasant background - took the peasant skills a step further and is known for fighting dirty.  He is the warrior who will kick sand in an opponent's eyes so he can bash out their kneecaps.  Most often mercenaries for ill-reputed individuals and the like, the thug is always out for himself, though he can occasionally be steered towards more productive ventures.

%^CYAN%^Swashbuckler %^RESET%^- The swashbuckler is the flamboyant warrior.  She has learned the art of the flourish as well as the art of combat.  Often flipping about the battlefield, the swashbuckler finds ways to get around many obstacles and sometimes uses unusual tactics.  Swashbucklers feel comfortable as pirates and mercenaries, though some develop this style of fighting into an artform and enjoy it for its own sake.

%^BOLD%^%^RED%^Soldier %^RESET%^- The soldier is often of middle to high birth.  Usually taken into the military establishment of the area, the soldier is given formal training in the art of warfare.  She often knows a good deal about tactics and strategy, as well as generally fighting fair.  The soldier is all about technique and discipline, and this is reflected in her performance on the battlefield.

%^YELLOW%^Dervish %^RESET%^- The dervish is an uncommon warrior.  They are often of nomadic birth, though not always.  A strange blend of swashbuckler and soldier, the dervish works endlessly to perfect his own unique fighting style.  No dervish fights quite like any other, though they all share certain characteristics.  A dervish is graceful and lithe, preferring fluid movements to the brawn of a soldier or thug.  He is the most graceful of all the fighters, surpassing even the swashbuckler, though without the aerial feats.  A dervish is often seen spinning about the battlefield, weapons flying.
