%^CYAN%^Time Limits%^RESET%^
One of the problems we have encountered is: How long do you need to wait before you can interact with the other person? We've recently simplified this to hopefully make post-PK interaction easier to deal with.

Neither the killer nor the victim may use any means to contact the other person or find out information about them. The victim is dead, the situation is over. This means no scrying, no listening shadows, no tells, nothing. This state lasts until the killer and victim happen to run into each other IN PERSON. When they do encounter each other in person, they have the chance to interact with each other, provided that 4 days real-time have passed. Prior to this, the players MUST ignore each other if they do bump into one another, as if they were strangers - because the victim should, to all belief, be quite dead. This is to allow time for the victim to recover.

%^BOLD%^%^RED%^Following the 4 days realtime%^RESET%^, however, the victim can be re-involved in any plots (including those they may have previously been involved in. They can also be involved in PK regarding these plots again. It is by this point that the killer, should they run into the victim, can realise that their victim is, in fact, quite alive, and any interactions (plot, PK or otherwise) can continue normally from here. All previous plot interactions can be remembered and resumed by the victim, except those involving their direct death. %^BOLD%^%^RED%^Namely, they do not remember who killed them.%^RESET%^ Bearing in mind that revenge killings are illegal, this rule remains for a good reason. Other than this, after the 4 day downtime they are able to remember everything else.

%^CYAN%^Special Note: %^RESET%^No interaction such as scrying, telling, etc, may take place between the victim and killer until *after* they have seen one another IC and the 4 days time limit has passed. The only exception is if the time limit has already passed and the killer receives word that is reliable enough for him to believe the victim is still living (not just one person says "Oh, Victim is still alive." but the killer hears from 2 or 3 people or hears word that the victim has done something else).
