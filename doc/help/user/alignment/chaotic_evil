%^RESET%^A chaotic evil character does whatever his greed, hatred, and lust for destruction drive him to do.  He is hot-tempered, vicious, arbitrarily violent, and unpredictable.  If simply out for whatever he can get, he is ruthless and brutal.  If he is committed to the spread of evil and chaos, he is even worse.  Thankfully, his plans are haphazard, and any groups he joins or forms are poorly organized.  Typically, chaotic evil people can only be made to work together by force, and their leader lasts only as long as he can thwart attempts to topple or assassinate him.  The demented sorcerer pursuing mad schemes of vengeance and havoc is chaotic evil.  Chaotic evil is sometimes called "demonic" because demons are the epitome of chaotic evil.  Chaotic evil is the most dangerous alignment because it represents the destruction not only of beauty and life but of the order on which beauty and life depend.
