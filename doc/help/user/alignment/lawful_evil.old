Lawful evil:
     These characters believe in using society and its laws to benefit themselves.  Structure and organization elevate those who deserve to rule as well as provide a clearly defined hierarchy between master and servant.  To this end, lawful evil characters support laws and societies that protect their own concerns.  If someone is hurt or suffers because of a law that benefits lawful evil characters, too bad.  Lawful evil characters obey laws out of fear of punishment.  Because they may be forced to honor an unfavorable contract or oath they have made, lawful evil characters are usually very careful about giving their word.  Once given, they break their word only if they can find a way to do it legally, within the laws of the society.  An iron-fisted tyrant and a devious, greedy merchant are both examples of lawful evil characters.
