%^RESET%^A lawful evil villain methodically takes what he wants within the limits of his code of conduct without regard to whom it hurts.  He cares about tradition, loyalty, and order, but not about freedom, dignity, or life.  He plays by the rules, but without mercy or compassion.  He is comfortable in a hierarchy and would like to rule, but he is willing to serve.  He condemns others not according to their actions but according to race, homeland, or social rank.  He is loath to break laws or promises.  This reluctance is partly because of his nature and partly because he depends on order to protect himself from those who oppose him on moral grounds.  Some lawful evil villains have particular taboos, such as not killing in cold blood (but having underlings do it) or not letting children come to harm (if it can be helped).  They imagine that these compunctions put them above unprincipled villains.  The scheming baron who expands his power and exploits his people is lawful evil.  Some lawful evil people and creatures are committed to evil with a zeal like that of a crusader committed to good.  Beyond being willing to hurt others for their own ends, they take pleasure in spreading evil as an end unto itself.  They may also see doing evil as part of a duty to an evil deity or master.  Lawful evil is sometimes call "diabolical" because devils are the epitome of lawful evil.  Lawful evil is the most dangerous alignment because it represents methodical, intentional, and frequently successful evil.
