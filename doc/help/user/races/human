Planetouched: Creatures referred to as 'planetouched' are human, but have some kind of planar ancestor at some point in their history. These consist of tieflings (fiendish blood), aasimar (celestial blood), and genasi (elemental blood). These should not be confused with half-bloods, who bear a direct planar parent.
