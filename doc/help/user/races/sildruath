%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
%^RESET%^One of the eldest and least numerous of elven races, Sildruath are one of the few pure elves that remained unchanged through the ages due to preference to live in seclusion of tall mountains. Their society resembles that of ancient elves, they stay within remote communities and keep to their kin. It is unlikely to see a Sildruath adventuring, so people dismiss them as nothing more than fairy tales. Individuals that adventure are often mistaken for deva.

Winged and built much as birds, with frame of brittle frame of hollow bones, they tend to have pale skin and gem-like eyes of green, blue or purple. Their wings are usually white, though black-winged avariel do exist, and their hair color generally matches that of their wings. Nearly extinct from ancient wars between themselves and saurians, they bear an intense enmity and distrust for them. They went into seclusion long before The Crown Wars between elves and most are not aware of the betrayal of the drow. They have long standing neutrality with ogre-magi as these races often share different levels of mountainous peaks. Sildruath are aware of and avoid orcs and all goblinoids.
