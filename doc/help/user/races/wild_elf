%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
%^RESET%^One of the three eldest elven races, and equally reclusive as 
their early cousins.  They tend to be a stealthy, feral species much 
more primitive than other elven kind, and known as the 'wild' cousins 
of other more distinguised elves.  They tend towards relatively stocky 
frames, for an elf, with dark brown skin.  Their hair ranges through 
shades of black and brown, fading much in the way of humans to a 
silvery-white as they age.
