%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Description:
%^GREEN%^Lycanthropy has many possible origins, some are the result of terrible curses, others are magic rituals which bind animal spirits to human bodies. What is constant, though, is that lycanthropes are persons capable of assuming animalistic forms, most commonly that of a great wolf. In some cultures these shapeshifters are monstrous villains, the result of dark curses and evil magic that spread terror and evil throughout the world. In others, they are great warriors who fight like wild animals on the battlefield, and while terrible and awe-inspiring, they are ultimately heroic figures.

%^GREEN%^All werewolves have three forms: a humanoid form, a wolf form, and a hybrid form. Equipment does not meld with the new form between humanoid and hybrid form, but does between those forms and animal form. A werewolf can shift to any of its three alternate forms as a move action. A slain werewolf reverts to its humanoid form, although it remains dead. A werewolf gains a bite attack when it is in its wolf form. In addition, when a werewolf is in its wolf form, it also gains the trip special attack with its bite, allowing it to make a trip attempt against a target as a free action.

%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Player characters:
%^GREEN%^Being a werewolf is a strange experience. As mentioned there are many various legends surrounding this state of being so you'll have to construct your own story and lore that befits your gameplay, whether you choose to howl at the moon in raged frenzy, or to travel between cities and trade spices for apples.

%^GREEN%^Mechanics wise lycanthropy gives any of the class you choose powers that look similar to rage and the druidic way of shapeshifting. There is no restriction on what you can combine with - except for an incompatibility with rage-like states and transformation-like spells - but many paths, such as pure casters, will cripple your mechanically, leaving your alternate forms for roleplay only.

%^GREEN%^Lycanthropy is an aquired template and has to be either set by an imm or selected during creation by players with an advanced player account (an account with L30+ character).
