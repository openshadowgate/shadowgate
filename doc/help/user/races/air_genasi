%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
Air genasi are humans with an ancestor from the plane of air, usually an 
elemental.  They are fast and free-willed creatures, who revel in their 
individuality, although few care enough to seek out their progenitor.  
Many regard them with awe, which only serves to encourage their 
flamboyant natures, and their expectation that normal folk will treat 
them with deference.  They tend to travel a lot, many feeling confined by 
staying in one place for too long.  Air genasi priests must follow a 
deity that offers the domain of air; this means Akadi, Auril or 
Shaundakul.

Air genasi should not be confused with half-elementals, who are a 
different species, rather than a subspecies of human.  They have the 
appearance of a human except for one or two physical attributes that 
carry over from their lineage.  Some examples are:
-pale-white, light-blue, or slightly cool skin
-white or light-blue hair
-constant slight breeze in their presence
-voice that can be heard over any nonmagical wind
-sudden movements are accompanied by a whistling wind
