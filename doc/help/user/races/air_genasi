%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
Air genasi are humans with an ancestor from the plane of air, usually an elemental. They are fast and free-willed creatures, who revel in their individuality, although few care enough to seek out their progenitor. Many regard them with awe, which only serves to encourage their flamboyant natures, and their expectation that normal folk will treat them with deference. They tend to travel a lot, many feeling confined by staying in one place for too long. Air genasi priests prefer to follow a deity that offers the domain of air.

Air genasi should not be confused with half-elementals, who are a different species, rather than a subspecies of human.  They have the appearance of a human except for one or two physical attributes that carry over from their lineage.  Some examples are:

 - pale-white, light-blue, or slightly cool skin
 - white or light-blue hair
 - constant slight breeze in their presence
 - voice that can be heard over any nonmagical wind
 - sudden movements are accompanied by a whistling wind
