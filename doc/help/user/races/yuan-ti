%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
Yuan-ti are an ancient species, proud descendants of interbreeding between humans and the long-lost protosaurian creator race. Due to their long (and relatively unsuccessful) history of attempts at taking over human kingdoms, and the resulting hostilities between the two races, they tend to keep their lairs secret. In modern times yuan-ti have learned that subtlety is more successful than the direct approach, and so they still continue their attempts at the subjugation of humankind, but by infiltration and stealth.

Yuan-ti are arrogant by nature, believing their race to be superior to all others, and that it is only a matter of time before the realm is theirs, much as they are taught that it once belonged to their saurian forebears. They use this belief to justify all kinds of evil - they simply want back what they see as rightfully theirs.

Only pureblood yuan-ti are commonly encountered, given their close appearance to humans. They appear much as normal humans do, but with subtle reptilian features (such as snake eyes, forked tongues, pointed teeth, or patches of scaled skin. They are the servants of the yuan-ti half-bloods and abominations, the leaders of their society, whose serpentine features are far more pronounced.
