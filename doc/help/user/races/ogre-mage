%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
Ogre magi are 10 1/2 feet tall and have dark eyes. They usually have light blue, light green, or pale brown skin, along with a pair of ivory horns on their forehead. Their hair is usually a different color from that of their skin, and is a darker shade (except ogre magi with pale brown skin and yellow hair). They have black nails and dark eyes with white pupils. Their teeth and tusks are usually pure white.

Ogre magi tend to be more civilized than ogres, and they live in caves or fortified dwellings. They have a great respect for their clans, following many oriental traditions, including dress and weapon use. Ogre magi prefer to use magic rather than force, but they can be just as fierce as their ogre relatives.

There are several subraces of ogre-magi which define physical appearance.

Water oni usually have blue skin and they are most adaptive to changes.
Fire oni are three-eyed and usually have red skin, their temper is quite volatile.
Void oni have three eyes and ash gray skin and more inclined to study than to battle.
Kuwa oni have four fingers on their hands and golden skin and are least volatile

It is said the difference used to be caused by spirits ogre magi took the form from upon coming to material existence. Oni tend to form clans based on their spiritual ancestry, but it is not a formal restriction.
