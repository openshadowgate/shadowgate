%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
The feytouched are humans who have been tainted by fey energies in their bloodline, which happens less often than one might assume. Perhaps an ancestor was a nymph, or a fomorian. Perhaps they have simply lived in the fey realms for generations, becoming slowly acclimated to the plane in which they dwell. Whatever the case, these creatures are mostly human, but carry with them a small hint of something unearthly and magical, and silly.

Feytouched are quite varied in personality and outlook. Some are beautiful and elven, with wispy, delicate features, and others resemble brutish swamp creatures, with misshapen limbs and warty skin. They are always marked by some distinctly inhuman property, such as feathered eyebrows, goblin ears, or a propensity for speaking in rhyme.

Feytouched have no cohesive society: each feytouched is generally unique, though occasionally family lineages will form. Feytouched can't help but attract attention, though their physical appearance often dictates how they use it - beautiful feytouched sample all the luxuries civilized life has to offer, while the brutish, ugly feytouched tend to favor natural environments, and the wild creatures therein.
