%^BOLD%^%^BLACK%^Description:%^RESET%^
%^ORANGE%^Afflicted with the outsiders curse, weretigers are lycanthropes who can switch between humanoid, hybrid, and tiger form. They are one of the most feared and distrusted types of lycanthrope. Most weretigers believe they have a divine right to rule over lesser "prey" creatures, and seek to carve out as large a domain as possible. They brook no rivals, and as a result natural weretigers are most commonly found alone, or sometimes as a mated pair.

%^ORANGE%^Weretigers are ferocious hunters and warriors with a haughty and fastidious nature. Lithe and sleekly muscular in humanoid form, they are taller than average and meticulously groomed. Weretigers grow to enormous size in animal and hybrid form, but they fight in their more refined humanoid form when they can.

%^ORANGE%^Weretigers live in jungles, or temperate forests, on the fringes of humanoid civilization, traveling to isolated settlements to trade or revel. A few evil weretigers see explorers as a kind of sport to hunt, which they did by posing as normal humans to lure people into their traps. This was seen as justified by them, as they believed it villainous for people to plunder their land

%^ORANGE%^Natural weretigers in humanoid form have large eyes, long noses, and sharp cheekbones. Most have brown or red hair, though a few have white, black, or even blue-gray. Afflicted weretigers retain their original characteristics. Their movements appear careful yet casual, and a person observing one could easily assume he’s watching a skilled pickpocket, graceful dancer, or sultry courtesan.

%^ORANGE%^Unlike with werewolves the source of your affliction is known: a curse - or a blessing - brought in by outsiders. It expected to warp your mind accordingly, leaving you less freedom of choice you might have in other lycanthropic forms. Not being strictly hunted down, you might find being less accepted than normal races. Weretigers are expected to be sometimes vicious or in eternal struggle to fight own ferocity.

%^ORANGE%^Weretiger is an acquired template and has to be either set by the staff or selected during creation by players with an advanced player account (an account with a L30+ character).%^RESET%^
