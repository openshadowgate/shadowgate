%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
Dryads are beautiful women with delicate features seemingly made of soft wood. Their hair is made of leaves and foliage that changes color with the seasons of the calendar. During the spring and summer months, the hair of a dryad is lush and green, while during autumn it turns red and eventually brown in the winter.

Dryads prefer to live away from civilization, delighting in the savage wilderness away from those that seek to cut their trees. They live with respect to nature and accept the company of those that do so as well.

Dryads are generally benign, but as with everything, there are exceptions. Particularly cruel people that are determined to destroy a dryad's forest will know the full wrath of these fey, and their wrath is no small thing. Being long-lived creatures, a dryad has no shortage of time to torment and utterly destroy their enemies, for generations to come.

Like a tree that has turned rotten with disease, a blighted, evil dryad will seek to spread their pain and torment to everything that surrounds them. A dryad turned vile is truly a twisted creature, and will see entire cities wiped out for even the slightest of offenses. These malicious fey will destroy a man's heart and home, and do so with a charming smile on her lips.
