%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
A half-drow's skin tone ranges from light grey to dusky grey. Their eyes glow with the same fire that their elven parents have. Eye color is almost always black or red, but in rare cases it will be blue or brown. Their hair is often white or silver, but it is not unheard of for them to have blonde or brown hair. Their ears are like other half-elves, long and pointed.

The half-drow are outcasts in all societies. The drow loathe them, killing their parents. Other elves pity them and seek to kill them to end their suffering. All other races fear them because of their drow heritage. Although not all half-drow are evil, they tend towards neutral evil due to the fact that so many hate them, they see the world as a terrible place where they must defend themselves at every corner. Many half-drow are suicidal or at the least put themselves into harm's way more times than necessary.

No creature of any race, including other half-drow, like half-drow. Very few will ever trust them.

Half-drow are extremely difficult to play due to the fact they will be hated and killed by almost all others, including their own kind. Only experienced SG players who are also reasonably adept at PK and PK survival and are willing to deal with the setbacks of being PKed often and not cry foul should even consider playing a one.
