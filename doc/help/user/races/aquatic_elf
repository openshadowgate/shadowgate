%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
Low from below the deep, close to ancient leviathans that swam primordial oceans, a branch of elvenkin lives. Changed and adapted through the arcane to the deep, this aquatic race of elves hasn't been seen on the surface for eons, and was rumored to be extinct. When the Silence shut down the old powers, curious souls of these species, at times entire cities full of them, rose to the surface to walk The Dry for the first time in thousands of years. Though more open to contact, they still remain uneasy and unwelcoming toward drywalkers, including their former cousins. Prideful and arrogant, they consider themselves to be, by many measures, superior to the barbaric "civilizations" of The Dry.

Aquatic elves have a supernatural affinity toward magic in all of its forms, and they have a curious attitude toward everything. Secretive without exception, they tend to stay close to their own kind, with few ever venturing to speak to the land-dwellers. Those who walk the surface are either exiles, explorers, or diplomatic envoys.

Aquatic elves have a morphed elven appearance to suit their sub-nautical lives, with gills, fins, and even tails. Their skin coloration varies from pale white to light cyan and deep green. There are many cities in the deep, and they all are different in one way or another.
