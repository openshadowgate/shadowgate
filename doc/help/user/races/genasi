%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Genasi:

Genasi are humans with an ancestor of elemental outsider blood, that vary greatly in appearance and demeanor depending upon the nature of that ancestor. The four most common kinds of genasi are air, earth, fire and water, though genasi also exist from breeding with para-elementals, such as smoke and ice. Genasi often consider themselves superior to normal humans, and while some maintain this as quiet pride, others can appear openly arrogant. They are usually regarded with caution, but sometimes are outcast and feared, due to their differences.

Genasi should not be confused with half-elementals, who are a different species, rather than a subspecies of human. They have the appearance of a human except for one or two physical attributes that carry over from their lineage.
