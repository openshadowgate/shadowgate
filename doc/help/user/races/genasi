%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Genasi:

Genasi are humans with an ancestor of elemental outsider blood, that vary 
greatly in appearance and demeanor depending upon the nature of that 
ancestor.  The four most common kinds of genasi are air, earth, fire and 
water, though genasi also exist from breeding with para-elementals, such 
as smoke and ice.  Genasi often consider themselves superior to normal 
humans, and while some maintain this as quiet pride, others can appear 
openly arrogant.  They are usually regarded with caution, but sometimes 
are outcast and feared, due to their differences.

Genasi should not be confused with half-elementals, who are a different 
species, rather than a subspecies of human.  They have the appearance of 
a human except for one or two physical attributes that carry over from 
their lineage.
