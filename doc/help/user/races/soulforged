%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
As constructs, soulforged are created rather than born out of members of core races by placing a captured soul into a clockwork body. Unlike golems, they are not restricted by their creator's orders and thus are capable to operate beyond simple instructions.

As resolve in living soul can sustain it for centuries, or even indefinitely, soulforged are truly immortal. However, no human soul is accustomed to existence in a metal body, thus mental breakdowns or aberrative behavior is a norm among soulforged. In the end, the mind and soul of the soulforged always grows alien to members of their host species under an internal pressure. They share many aspects of existence with the undead, but by definition do not belong either among living or the dead.

Soulforged are made primarily out of human souls. As the process is unreliable and many souls of the subjects perish in the creation members of other, less populous, races are rarely used. Needless to say creation of the soulforged is followed by activities strictly outlawed by any civilized societies. Soulforged themselves are either pitied or outright hunted to be enslaved or put down out of their misery.

Soulforged posses metal bodies with clockwork cores to host their souls. They have very humanoid-like appearance and their physiology corresponds that to the host as close as possible. Their bodies are made out of common metals and core is forged out of iron, the eyes are perfectly cut gems.
