%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^History: %^RESET%^%^CYAN%^Given to a mischievious nature ever since his youth, Callamir grew up among the halflings of the Shadow meadows. He was regularly in trouble for his pranks and his light fingers, at first with family and friends, and later right across the realm as he took up a life of travelling and constant motion. During the Silence of 737SG, his opportunistic nature came to the fore after it seems sheer good fortune crossed his path with a lost relic. Gathering others through gambling, tricks, or outright theft, he nearly met a short end on crossing several powerful wizards, but a spot of luck allowed him to turn the tables on them, redirecting their magical strength to aid him in his ascent to divinity.

%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Regards to Undead: %^RESET%^%^CYAN%^The faithful of the Trickster avoid use of undead, seeing them as dangers to those who travel and adventure.

%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Vestments: %^RESET%^%^CYAN%^Formal attire for priests of Callamir is a paired long-sleeved azure shirt and pants, trimmed with silver patterning at sleeve and ankle, the more detailed the better. Amulets crafted to look like rabbit's feet are favored not only by the priesthood, but also by lay followers.%^RESET%^

%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Faith-based groups:
%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^The Sparrows: %^RESET%^%^CYAN%^A group of thieves and informants that work for the temple, keeping track of affairs and secrets realm-wide to try and oppose dark forces and further the faith's own goals.
%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^The Trailblazers: %^RESET%^%^CYAN%^The largest official group within the faith, who offer their services as guides and caravan guards. They try to encourage wanderlust in those they meet, working to show the beauty and freedom of the open road.
%^BOLD%^%^WHITE%^Trueflight Pinions: %^RESET%^%^CYAN%^Masters of archery who seek to further their craft beyond all else. While they will often work in defense of the faith and its followers, their true calling is to perfect their skill with bow and arrow.
