Language on ShadowGate

The concept behind language on ShadowGate MUD is to enhance the
RP of the game. I always pick on ogres, so why stop here, IE:
if I'm an ogre with a 5 intelligence how can I have an intelligent
conversation with a dwarf and elf and a human, non of whom know
ogrish? Languages affect all forms of inter-personal communication.
More than likely the debate concerning languages on public lines will
go on forever. If you have any knowledge of a language it will appear
in your <languages> command list. The number next to the language listing
is the proficiency with which you speak the language. IE I understand about
45% of the language (etc etc). The number in () is the progress toward a
greater understanding. IE I'm about 65% of the way to understanding this
new facet of the language.
Currently you receive languages by intelligence. Intelligence determines
how many you can learn. We are debating some kind of supplementing system.
For the moment you can only learn as many as your intelligence allows.
You learn languages from other folk who know the language well and have
the inclination to teach you. To teach someone you use the <teach> command.
To set what language you speak in use the <speak> command.
