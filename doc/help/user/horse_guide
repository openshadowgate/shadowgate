%^CYAN%^%^ULINE%^A GUIDE TO HORSES AND MOUNTS%^RESET%^

For a list of horse commands, please see %^ORANGE%^<help horses>%^RESET%^.

%^CYAN%^INTRODUCTION
The world of Shadowgate MUD offer a variety of horses and other mounts to ease your travels.  Travelling by horseback requires less stamina and may shorten the duration of your trip.  Specially trained war horses and even flying mounts are available at selected stables.  Visit your local stable-hand today for a good deal!  %^CYAN%^Note:%^RESET%^  Stables can be found in most major cities and some rural areas, but the selection varies greatly from city to city.  Should you already own a mount, this is the polite place to leave it before enjoying a night at the local inn.

%^CYAN%^SKILL: ATHLETICS%^RESET%^ 

You will need ranks in the skill %^CYAN%^athletics%^RESET%^ to properly ride a mount.  War horses and exotic animals require a higher score than docile horses and ponies.  If you find that your mount is disobeying your commands or even throwing you off, you need to increase your athletics skill.  %^CYAN%^Note:  %^RESET%^The area in which the mount is acquired should give you a good idea of the required skill level.  A horse from Tabor, for instance, should be suitable for the young adventurer, while an exotic animal from Azha or Seneca will require the skill of a more seasoned traveller.

%^CYAN%^FLYING MOUNTS%^RESET%^

Flying mounts should only be used by the most experienced riders.  We recommend  riding the mount along the ground for a while to test your ability before taking flight.  If your skill level is too low, you might fall off mid-air!  Unless you have a way to avoid hitting the ground, such a fall may well prove fatal.  %^CYAN%^Note:  %^RESET%^Mounts can only fly to locations that you have previously remembered.  They cannot land inside or in areas that have been warded from teleportation.  Please see %^ORANGE%^<help remember>, <help recall>%^RESET%^ and %^ORANGE%^<help unremember>%^RESET%^. 

%^CYAN%^COMMANDS

There are several commands available, listed in %^ORANGE%^<help horses>%^RESET%^.  Most require that you specify which mount you wish to interact with by using its %^CYAN%^"type (or ID)"%^RESET%^ as the target of the command, such as "donkey, "camel", "pegasus" etc. Horses may have an additional ID like "steed", "mare" or "warhorse" to help you interact with them. 
 
%^CYAN%^DESCRIPTIONS:

Shadowgate allows you describe the mounts that you buy, by setting their short (adjective) and long descriptions (describe). As of now, short and long descriptions do not save.  We recommend you use an alias to set these more easily upon login.  See %^ORANGE%^<help alias>%^RESET%^. 

%^BOLD%^%^CYAN%^Please note: 
%^GREEN%^Your mount's adjective (name mount) must be RP-appropriate and include the race and/or type of the animal in question ("pony", "horse", "camel" etc).  While you may give your mount a name, we prefer that you do not.  "Spot, a spotted pony" is an ok adjective, but "A brown spotted pony" is better.  Just "Spot" is not allowed, because passersby cannot identify it as a pony.

%^GREEN%^As with everything else in game, please use common sense when handling mounts.  The code may allow you to enter a shop or climb a rope with your horse, but that does not mean you should.  Likewise, a mount in an inn would likely cause a stir, an exotic mount in an inn may cause an uproar!
