It is said that heroes are destined to die young and the battlefields and dungeons of the world are a testament to that fact. But death alone cannot stop the heroes, of a certain caliber, who have a holy obligation or purpose to fulfill. These heroes are returned to glory as Deva in order to complete their holy missions and then ascend to the heavens. These Deva are granted additional powers and leeway to carry out their deity's will and become a force of divine intervention.
