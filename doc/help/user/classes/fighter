A trained fighter is perhaps the most diverse class of all. Fighters hail from all walks of life, following different codes and ethics, and training a diverse array of styles and weapons. As a fighter relies almost entirely upon his weapon skills for survival, the principal attribute of a fighter is strength, however, he may choose the weapon finesse feat in order to use dexterity instead. A good dexterity and constitution are always highly desirable. Fighters spend most of their time learning how to use weapons of different types, as well as honing their hand-to-hand combat skills and self defense abilities.

There are certain abilities granted only to fighters and they are:
 %^ORANGE%^<flash target>%^RESET%^ allows the fighter to perform an acrobatic attack, flipping, dodging or spinning to combat an opponent. This can be done often and can confuse, or damage an opponent.
 %^ORANGE%^<rescue target>%^RESET%^ This will cause you to move in front of the target and try to block the attacks to them, by taking the hits yourself.

Given their exceptional command of martial skill, fighters pick up combat abilities at a far greater rate than other classes. They gain one free combat feat for every five levels in the class.
