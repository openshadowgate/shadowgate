Druids are champions of nature, though they claim no power over it. Instead, a druid's power comes from being one with the natural world, revelling in the awesome destructive power of a storm and finding strength in the gentle rejuvenating potential of a calm pool. Druids are a mixed lot, following the paths of various deities and even holding to diverse truths about the natural world. As such, any two druids may not see eye-to-eye on many matters, including the very essence of nature itself. Many druids prefer to be solitary.

%^CYAN%^Druidic oaths:%^RESET%^ Druids train with natural weapons and armor, and they further take traditional oaths that restrict them from using metal armor. Druids avoid carrying much worked metal at all, believing that it interferes with the pure nature of the wilds. The reasoning behind these oaths depend on the druid's background.

Druids prepare their spells with the %^ORANGE%^<prepare>%^RESET%^ command. They can cast any spell from their spell list you can see with the %^ORANGE%^<spells druid>%^RESET%^ command. To cast they use the %^ORANGE%^<cast>%^RESET%^ command. They expend prepared spells from memory when they cast. They can see currently prepared spells with %^ORANGE%^<recall druid spells>%^RESET%^.

Druids are versatile and they can take many paths in their lives, becoming powerfull spellcaster or preferring feral lives in shapes of fearsome beasts, or even using their potential for martial combat in their humanoid form.

They can cast in any armour they can wear, but must not wield while casting.
