The barbarian is a fearsome warrior that channels his rage to devastating effect in battle. Barbarians typically hail from the edge of civilization, or in some cases, even beyond it. Eschewing the extensive training and professionalism found commonly among fighters, the barbarian taps into his primal rage to more than make up for his lack of regimented training.

Strength and constitution are the main attributes of the barbarian. The higher the barbarian's strength, the better chance he has to hit and damage his enemy. A high constitution enables the barbarian to withstand more punishment in the midst of a fray since they are always right in the middle of every battle they are in. A good dexterity is also recommended to further allow him to avoid blows during combat.

The barbarian's primary ability in battle is %^ORANGE%^<rage>%^RESET%^. Rage increases his innate strength, constitution, and will saves throughout its duration. This allows the barbarian to deal and take a great deal of damage, with its effect and duration increasing as the barbarian gains levels.

The barbarian is a melee class, so should rely on feats taken from the martial tree, check %^ORANGE%^<feats list martial>%^RESET%^ for a full list of what is potentially available to you.
