A warlock is a being whose soul is suffused with perilous magic, whether by willing or unwilling means. They do not approach magic through the medium of spells, much as a mage or sorcerer might. Instead, they can invoke magic through simply an act of will, resulting in a limited but powerful array of magical aids, trickery, and powerful blasts of eldrich power. While these effects are not spells, as spell-like abilities they are subject to most of the same factors, and benefit from most of the same feats and other empowerments, unless otherwise specified. Given their simple somatic attributes, warlock invocations can be cast in light armor.

Warlocks use the %^ORANGE%^<master>%^RESET%^ command to learn their invocations. Then they can just %^ORANGE%^<cast>%^RESET%^ any invocation they know at any time they want.

Warlocks can cast in light armor, but they can't do so while wielding normal weapons. However, they can cast while wielding weapons they have summoned.

Warlocks have a degree of versatility and can take both martial and spellcasting paths.
