Radiant Servants are clerics who have dedicated their lives to the 
art and skill of healing.  They are peerless when it comes to healing 
the injured.  A first level radiant servant gains the contingent 
healing feat which allows them to automatically heal any sufficiently 
injured member of their party. This automatic healing happens in 
addition to, and regardless of any other actions that the radiant 
servant takes in the round.  Only incapacitation of some sort can 
prevent the radiant servant from healing the most wounded of  his or 
her allies.  At level four, a radiant servant gains the ability to 
project an aura of healing.  This aura will heal injured party members
continually until they are at full health and can only be stopped by 
knocking the radiant servant unconscious or killing him.  Finally, at 
level seven a radiant servant gains the ability to cast any healing 
spell that he or she knows at will and an unlimited amount of times 
per day, without needing to prepare those spells.  In effect, the only
way to prevent a high level radiant servant from healing his or her 
allies is to render them unconscious or kill them.

Radiant Servants channel healing energy directly from their diety, 
and while they are blessed with extraordinary healing abilities, they 
are no more favored or disfavored than other priests of their faiths 
in matters not related to healing.  They are, however, without equal 
when it comes to keeping groups of allies alive.  A group with a 
radiant servant in their midst is a very difficult group to defeat.
