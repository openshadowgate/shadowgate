The functions which handle properties are contained in the file /std/prop.c
These ar simply special things about an object.  For instance, in some rooms,
you may not want a player to ba able to teleport.  You there for do this in
the create() of the room:

	set_property("no teleport", 1);

This file contains a list of properties and what they do.  Afterwards is an
explanation of the property handling functions.

*****************************************************************************

Nightmare properties:
----------------------

name: "no teleport"
value: 1
types of objects: rooms
ex: set_property("no teleport", 1);

All teleport spells check the room they are in to see if the room has the
value 1 for the property "no teleport".  If the value is 1, the teleport will
fail.  If there is no value, the teleport will succeed.

******

name: "full attacks"
value: 1
types of objects: monsters
ex: set_property("full attacks",1);

This will allow a monster of fighter classes to attack as a player
of same level. giving them full attacks per round instead of just 1.

name: magic
value: 1
types of objects: all
this property will allow any call to do_damage to break through a stoneskin. The object calling the do_damage function needs to have this property set to a non zero value.

name: "holy ground"
value: 1
types of objects: rooms

This property is like the 'no-killing' property, but it only goes into
effect during "Highlander" wars.  No player may attack anything on holy
ground.

******

name: "no magic"
value: 1
types of objects: rooms
ex: set_property("no magic", 1);

Much like "no teleport", except this property prevents the casting of any
spells, including spells like fireball, shock, and missile.

*****

name: "magic item"
value: string representing the name of a command
types of objects: treasure, armour, and weapons
ex: set_property("magic item", ({ "illuminate", "darken" }) );

A magic item is considered any item that performs a function other than one
considered possible according to the laws of physics.  For example, a helmet
that you can use to light the room through an illuminate spell is a magic
item, although a sword you use to pick a lock is not.  To use an item in
the Nightmare reality for an unnatural or supernatural use, there should
be a command that goes with it.  For example, you can set any armour of item
to have an illuminate spell.  This makes it a magic item, and the command
to have it work is "illuminate".  So the armour code, when you set_illuminate()
automatically does set_property("magic item", ({ "illuminate" }) );
The theory behind this is that you should not be able to tell that an item
does anything peculiar just by looking at it.  Instead it should take some
special powers to determine that an item has a magic function.  And clerics
and monks have a spell called sense that will find out what magic powers
if any an item has.

*****

name: "magic hold"
value: an int representing the strength of the hold
types of objects: things with locks
ex: set_property("magic hold", 15);

When a rogue tries to pick a lock, it is simply a random chance based
on the player's locks skill.  With a magic hold on the lock, it is
that number which is subtracted from the player's skill, making it harder
for the lock to be pick.  You can code this into a lock you want
to have harder to pick than most, or it can be placed on a lock by a mage,
or you might create a magic wand that casts a magic hold spell on locks.
See /obj/chest.c for an example of this at work.

*****

name: "monsterweapon"
value: int represneting if this is an exclusively monster item
types of objects: anything usable by a monster
ex: set_property("monsterweapon",1);

There are many items that are only proper in the hands(or such) of monsters.
The most common examples are the fangs of a snake, the claws of a dragon, and
so on. This property is checked when the monster dies and prevents them from
being transferred to the corpse object. the values are simply 1 and 0, to
flag whether the item is or isn't a monster weapon.

*****

name: "picking tool"
value: int representing how useful the object is in helping pick a lock
types of objects: armour, weapon, or treasure
ex: set_property("picking tool", 4);

When a rogue attempts to pick a lock, it checks all of the items in the
rogue's inventory for picking tools, which can be a dagger, or a skeleton
key.   No matter what it is, the total is added to the rogues lock picking
skill to give the rogue a greater chance of picking the lock.
These numbers should always be small for anything that is not specifically
made to be used in picking locks.

*****

name: "no attack"
value: 1
ex: set_property("no attack", 1);
types of objects: rooms

This makes a room a haven where no combat may take place.  It should only
be allowed in places where the textual nature of our Virtual Reality has
reached its limit, so it should be used rarely.  For example, rooms with
bulletin boards and such things where a player is in an input_to
situation make it difficult to respond to attack.  In addition, the main
pub is a haven for the sake of balance, although most probably should
not be havens.

*****

name: "no steal"
value: 1
ex: set_property("no steal", 1);
types of objects: rooms

Same as "no attack", except it prevents thievery.

*****

name: "keep"
value: lower case name of a player
ex: set_property("keep", "descartes");
types of objects: any gettable object

This property keeps anyone but the person named from picking up the item.
For instance, here, only Descartes can pick up the object.

*****

name: "strength"
value: fire ice magic water cold energy lightning (others may be added as well)
ex: set_property("strength", "water");
types of objects: living objects

Living objects may be resistent or vulnerable to attacks of certain types.
The strength property allows you to set this property in a monster, to make
the monster resistent to certain modes of attack.  If you have an item
that makes a certain type of attack, or a special attack which is of one
of the above mentioned types, you should add it to the attack code you
have written.

*****

name: "weakness"
value: same as for strength
ex: set_property("weakness", "ice");
types of objects: see strength

The same type of thing as strength, except this is for weaknesses.

*****

name "able to cast"
value: 1
ex: set_property("able to cast", 1);
types of objects:  Weapons

This property will allow a mage or cleric to cast a spell when wielding the weapon this property is set in.

*****************************************************************************

Property handling functions:
----------------------------

*****

set_property(string name, mixed values);
ex: set_property("magic item", ({ "illuminate", "darken" }) );

This adds a property to the properties of an object. Note that this
is additive.  This does not erase any values of the property previously set.
If you want to erase all the properties, first call remove_all_properties() 
and then set_property();

*****

remove_property(string name);
ex: remove_property("no teleport");

Removes the property from the object.

*****

remove_property_value(string name, mixed values);
ex: remove_property_value("magic item", ({ "illuminate" }) );

This subtracts the value from the previous value of the property.

*****

remove_all_properties();

This clears out the object so it has no properties at all.

*****

mixed query_property(string name);
ex: query_property("magic item");

This returns all of the values of a given property.
