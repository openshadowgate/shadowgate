Nightmare Mudlib lfun: set_search()
Object: /std/room.c (inherited from /std/room/senses.c)

void set_search(string item, mixed desc);

This function makes something happen when a player types the search command
and uses 'item' as an argument.  The first argument is, of course, the
item that will get searched.  If you want it to work when the player
enters "search" alone, item should be "default".  The second
argument is either an argument of type string or type function.
If the argument is a string, then that string will simply get printed
when the playertypes the command.  If it is of type function, the function
named gets called when the player types the search command.

Examples:
    set_search("shelf", "You find only dust on the shelf.");
    set_search("floor", (: this_object(), "search_floor" :));
