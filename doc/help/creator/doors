In this document is a tutorial on how to use the vault.c object that comes
with the Nightmare mudlib.  This is an object which inherits room.c for rooms
with doors.  Doors were not included in room.c, because the overhead of 
having all the door functions in simple rooms which, for the most part, do
not make use of doors was thought to be wasteful.  The following functions
regarding the creation of doors are described in the tutorial:

void set_door(string id, string dest, string dir, string key);
void set_open(string id, int open);
void set_locked(string id, int open);
void set_func(string id, string which, string fun);
void set_string(string id, string which, string str);
void set_door_pre_exit_function(string id, string fun);
int query_open(string id);
int query_locked(string id);

Part I: setup
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
To set up a door, you need two rooms which inherit "/std/vault".
Each room must AT LEAST have the functions set_door();
This function looks like this:
    set_door("door", "/d/standard/locked", "south", "honor key");
OR
    set_door("portal", "/d/standard/foo", "east", 0);

The first argument is an id.  This is because vault.c allows you to set up
multiple doors in a single room.  Each door must have a unique id.

The second argument is the room that the door leads to.  This will also be
listed in the rooms set_exits() function.  You may have more than one door
which leads to the same exit.

The third argument is the command typed by the player to go through the door
when open (again, listed with the destination room in set_exits()).  You
may only have one door respond to each command.

The final argument is the id of a key which a player must have in order to
lock or unlock the door.  If the door has no lock, then this argument should
be 0.

This function sets up a door in a room that is closed and unlocked when the
room is created.  But you need to make sure the room on the other side of
the door has setup the door as well. Assuming the first case in the two
examples above, we therefore need to set up a room in /d/standard/locked
In that room, we therefore have the line:
    set_door("door", "/d/standard/house", "north", "honor key");
This will set up a door in /d/standard/locked that leads north to the room
above, using the same key.  At room creation, it too is closed, but unlocked.

If you want the room to return to opening conditions at reset(), then you 
reset the conditions ONLY IN ONE ROOM.  This is because, with some drivers,
reset() in different objects are called at different times.  You therefore,
whenever manipulating the state of the door, want to make sure that the rooms
controls are set for both rooms.  Therefore, in one of these rooms (it does
not matter which), you will have the reset() function as follows:
(we will assume the reset is in /d/standard/locked)

void reset() {
    set_open("door", 0);
    set_locked("door", 0);
    "/d/standard/house"->set_open("door", 0);
    "/d/standard/house"->set_locked("door", 0);
}

This is the minimum amount of work needed to setup a door between two rooms
on the Nightmare mudlib.  But there are of course many other features of
which you can make use.  The first bit will be to explain the locking and
opening functions used in reset() above, so that you may set you room to
be in any state you like on creation and at reset().

****************************************************************************

Part II: opening, closing, locking, and unlocking the doors
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The default settings for all doors are closed, but unlocked.  Most people
will want their doors closed but locked(if they have a lock).  The
manipulation of locks and the opening is done through the 2 following
functions:

    set_open("door", 1);
    set_locked("door", 1);

The first argument of both functions is the id of the door which is being
affected.  The second argument is either true or false, where you are setting
the door to be open (1) or closed (0) and locked(1) or unlocked(0).
In general, the only time you should even call these functions are in
create() and reset().  The actual open, close, lock, unlock commands and
handling of those commands are already contained in vault.c.  In addition,
if you want to add something extra to any of these commands (for instance,
to check not only if the player has the right key (which vault.c already does),
but you also want to make it harder for drunk people to unlock the door), then
there is a way to do it, and there is no need to mainpulate these controls.
Remember, however, WHEREVER YOU USE ONE OF THESE FUNCTIONS, USE IT ALSO IN THE
ROOM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR.  Otherwise you will create an
inconsistency.

***************************************************************************

Part III: status checking
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are two functions which check the status of the door:
    int query_locked("door");
    int query_open("door");

These two functions tell you whether or not the door is open or locked :)

***************************************************************************

Part IV: creating your own functions
----------------------------------------------------------------
There are three functions which allow you to manipulate what happens when
a player tries to open, close, lock, or unlock a door.  These are:

    set_string("door", "open", "You hear the door creak as you open it.\n");
    set_func("door", "unlock", "check_drunkard");
    set_door_pre_exit_function("door", "no_can_do");

The simplest of these is the set_string() function.  This allows you to set a
custom message to the use when he/she locks, unlocks, opens, or closes the door.
They only see the message if they successfully open the door.

The first argument is the id of the doors for which you are setting this
message.

The second argument states which command the message is designed for.

The third argument gives the message the player sees when the command is
successful. 

The example above would therefore look like this to the player:
>north
The door is closed.
>open door
You hear the door creak as you open it.
>

Otherwise, the player would have seen "You open the door." Dull indeed!

There are some events which you may not want a player to perform a given
command, even though he/she has the key or the door is unlocked, etc.
For instance, perhaps you want to make it randomly possible that a drunk
player cannot put the key in the keyhole?

    set_func("door", "unlock", "check_drunkard);

would check a function you defined called check_drunkard() if all other
conditions for unlocking the door are met.  If your function returns 1, then
the player can unlock the door, if it returns 0, the player cannot.  So
you might define the check_drunkard() function like this:

int check_drunkard() {
    if(!this_player()->query_intox()) return 1;
    if(random(101) < 10) {
	write("You fumble with the key, but you are too drunk to fit it in the hole.\n");
	say(this_player()->query_cap_name()+" fumbles drunkenly with the key.\n");
	return 0;
    }
    return 1;
}

When the player types the command <unlock door with key>, if the player
has the key, the door is closed and locked, then the driver checks to see
that check_drunkard() returns 1.  If it returns 1, the player unlocks the
door.  Otherwise the player does not.  In this case, if the player is sober,
it allows him/her to unlock the door.  If the player is drunk, then the
player has a 10% chance of not being able to unlock the door.

The last function is similar to room.c's set_pre_exit_functions() function.
Since vault.c uses that function for the exit use by the door, if you
want to define your own pre-exit function, then you will have to use
set_door_pre_exit_function() instead.  The functionality is EXACTLY the same,
except the call for set_door_pre_exit_function() takes two strings, whereas
set_pre_exit_functions() takes two string arrays.  If this all confuses you,
then don't worry.  You should understand room.c set_pre_exit_functions()
before trying to use this anyways.  Simply put however, it is just like
the set_func() described above, except it is called when the player
tries to get through the open door.

***************************************************************************

Addendum: about keys
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The lock and unlock commands of vault.c check that the player has ANY
object with the id in question.  So NEVER set your key to being "key",
because then any old key will unlock/lock your door.
The id is the only thing that matters to the command.  Nothing else about
the object makes a difference.

Also, you might want to disable lock_picking for some reason (this should
be done only in special circumstances, as this otherwise cheapens the
rogue lockpicking ability).  To do that, do the following:

int pick_lock(string str) { return 0; }

We recommend, instead, that you use the magic hold property described in the
document on properties to make it more difficult for a rogue to pick the
lock.  Holds apply to the room in which the picking is taking place, not to
individual doors.

And one last thing.  Every doors should be an item in set_item_descriptions()
or set_item_functions() (as defined in room.c).  set_item_functions() is
preferred, since you should probably differentiate in the description
between an open and closed door.  Things will get messed up if you fail
to define the door in the descriptions.
