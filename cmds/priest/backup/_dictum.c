Spell  : Dictum
Level  : 7th Level
Sphere : Combat
Domain : Vigilance
Syntax : chant dictum on <target>

This spell will hurl a bolt of magical force at the target.
If the target fails their save, they will be hit full force
with the magical power of the bolt, doing tremendous damage.
Otherwise they are able to avoid the full impact and suffer
only a grazing blow.
