"inaccessible.  And the room will exist for quite a long time, varying with the caster's spell-casting level.  To cast "
"this spell, the caster must drop a rope before them which will not be consumed by the casting.

Inside rope trick room you can:

%^ORANGE%^<pull rope>%^RESET%^
  Pulls up the access rope so that no one else can gain entry to this space.

%^ORANGE%^<lower rope>%^RESET%^
  Lowers the access rope to the outside room allowing access to this space.

%^ORANGE%^<peer out>%^RESET%^
  Allows you to look into the outside room.

%^ORANGE%^<out>%^RESET%^
  This is the exit to the outside world which is available as long as the rope is down.
