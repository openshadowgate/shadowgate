// Scry power stuff added by ~Circe~ 6/20/08 to fix problems with
// a scry blocker always thwarting scry, no matter the level of
// the casters involved.
//changed to have delay for followers - they should not be better spies than pc mages - Tsera
// duration on all scrying spells (and between-cast delays where relevant) rebalanced. Nienne, 5/15.

"\n\nThe mirror used must be of finely wrought and highly polished silver of a minimum cost of 1,000 gp.  These mirrors "
"are generally found only in wizard's laboratories as they are both large and fragile, making them impossible to carry "
"around.\n\nYou will not be able to scry a character that you have not recognized previously with the 'recognize' command"
".  Your chance of success in using the mirror on a character is less if you recognize someone as something other than "
"their true name, but its better than nothing.  You may not scry locations at all unless they are in memory via the "
"remember command.\n\nThere is also a chance that the target of the spell may notice that they are being scryed.  This "
"depends on their class, and is adjusted significantly by intelligence.  This operates independantly of any scry "
