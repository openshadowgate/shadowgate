"protect a small circle around the area in which he stands.  The glyph will alert the caster should any creature enter "
"the area protected by the glyph, and it will deliver a bit of a shock to the one who does.  Any creature already within "
"the protected area may leave without disturbing the glyph.  If a creature was within the glyph when it was created, he "
"or she may enter again without triggering the protective response.\n\nTypically, priests have been known to use this "
"spell to protect areas with treasure or to help ensure privacy.  Because the glyph generates energy that protects a "
"circle, it will guard all exits in a room.  However - like a circle - when it has been breached once, the energy will "
"dissipate, and the spell will end.  Additionally, thieves have a chance to search out and disable glyphs, though it does "
"take active concentration on their part.  A thief must make the search in the room preceding the room the glyph is "
"thought to be in.\n\nA priest may concentrate on only one glyph at a time, but he does not have to remain in the room "
"for the glyph to remain.");
