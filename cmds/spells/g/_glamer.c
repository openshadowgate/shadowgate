"quite recognizable as a creature of their race.\n\n"
"OOC: This spell does not alter details on your scoresheet (eyes, hair) but the caster may describe "
"their new form and features differently to these if they so choose. They must still maintain their "
"overall body shape (ie. race, general height and weight).\n\n"
"You can only have one altered form with this spell - repeat uses do not grant additional different "
"shapeshifts, but instead return you to the same secondary form. Adjective, description, speech, "
"messages etc will be remembered across castings, so they will only need to be set once in your "
"alternative form. Players will be able to recognise your 'other self' as a unique entity, separate "
"from your usual self.");
