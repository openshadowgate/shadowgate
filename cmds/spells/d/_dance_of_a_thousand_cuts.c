// Top end melee bard buff. Note that it can and does stack with heroism and haste, so no longer replicates the same bonuses.
// The idea of this spell is to boost them to parity with a fighter or similar pure-melee class.
// /daemon/bonus_d picks up the spell property to give them fighter-parity BAB/attacks innately, so the spell itself only sets the 
// property and attaches the AC.
