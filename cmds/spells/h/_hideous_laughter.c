// Hideous Laughter
/* Completely re-hashed the spell, to make its duration more reliable and
  avoid the random infinite_length bug that seemed to be caused by relying
  on set_tripped for the duration.
  New function set_length added, and length variable changed to global, to
  keep it constant between different functions.
  All changed noted where they are made.
  Old version saved as _hideous_laughter.lujke
