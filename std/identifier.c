//inherit for an "identifier" mob that will id or detect magic
//important code for this mob - you will need to set_id_uses();
//and set_detect_uses();, which will set the number of identify
//and detect magic spells the mob has, respectively
//You may also set_price() if you wish.  Price is altered based 
//on the player's level and charisma.  Identify prices are set 
//up to be 5 times the price of detect, but you can change this
//by doing set_highmod() on your particular mob if you want.
//The base code as it is will make characters level 10 and under 
//pay 70 gold for detect and 350 gold for identify.  Higher 
//level characters will be charged much, much more.  With the 
//current numbers in place, a level 20 would be charged 2800 for 
//a detect magic and 8400 for an identify.
//coded by ~Circe~ 6/12/05

//Adding the ability for identifiers to also use study to reveal lore
//For now, the study price is the same as the detect price
