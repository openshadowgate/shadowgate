/* by Styx - 3/31/02 for Shadow, converting to a /std/ inheritable 08/2005
* features - some are on the jail guard (attacking on picking or
*    unlocking as well as code for accepting a prisoner)
* - this room removes a prisoner's name from the array on them entering the main room
*  fines/bounties get removed (via user.c per Ares/Grendel) if a city guard kills them
*/

/* ****** notes to be zapped later when finished **************
>> move the wanted list from the Shadow guard file and Tonovi to SAVE_D ? <<<<<
>> let them collect fines too?
>> need to check the remove name function for jailers that are & aren't hms 

recognize by number
add aliases by number
list of reasons for bounties & fines
let avatars or immortals get a log by area by type of event (to confirm bounties, etc.)

finish jailers and others putting people in jail and paying bounties, etc.

add alias of testflunkytestaliases for testflunky wanted (should have been wanted testflunky)
   didn't work but no error message

list wanted gets a message of no bounties in that location, don't need ?
