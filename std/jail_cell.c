/* by Styx for Shadow jail 3/31/02, converted to /std/ inheritable 8/2005 
* - food and water force-feeding based on Crystal's code in Alliance dungeon,
* - added real food & water slipped under the door for unbound people
* - jail_main sets property of player age when put in, release after MAXTIME
* - Figure out how to make the guard yell shut up in there if someone yells?
* - Tried using GoThroughDoor to handle the check_released but couldn't get it working if they were being drug.  So, the main jail code has on init to handle that.
** set max jail time in player age (online time) for auto-release
** is in seconds so 10800 = 3 hrs. (could easily take 6-10 if they mostly
** idle and their time isn't all counting)
** 12/20/02 - doubled it and also made it 24 hrs. for people on the wanted list 
**   after someone got early release that shouldn't have - hopefully those won't 
**   get out sooner than 3 RL days now, if then and those involved with the RP
**   will follow up and check on them regularly
** 2/12 - reduced playtime max to 1hr, and overall RL time to 2hrs; slim playerbase
** isn't giving much option for escape/rescue/etc. Not fun to sit around. N.
* Lowered jail and wanted times again - Octothorpe 6/6/16
