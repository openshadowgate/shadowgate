# ShadowGate MUD lib #

This is LPC code repository. You'll need fluffos (https://www.fluffos.info/) and world files to utilize it.

As of 11.07.2019 this repository serves as a backup and tracking system only. The development happens from within metaprogramming environment of the game.

## Running the game ##

To compile fluffos for this lib you will need _conf/local_options.

To run fluffos with our settings you fill need to customize _conf/fluffos.example.cfg for your environment.

You will need to copy acl files to their location:

_conf/access.example.db adm/db/access.db
_conf/groups.example.db adm/db/groups.db
_conf/privs.example.db adm/db/privs.db

Only access.db might require an edit...
